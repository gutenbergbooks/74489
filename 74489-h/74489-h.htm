<hr class="tiny">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br>

<small>AN IMPORTANT LETTER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">News</span> from Uncle Adam!” cried my brother
Martin, as the maid, one morning, placed upon the
breakfast-table a letter, bearing a foreign postmark;
and the words are still fresh in my memory, for that
epistle influenced the fates of my father, brother, and
myself. It was addressed to our parent, in reply to
one he had sent to Batavia, some twelve months before.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear brother Claud,” it ran, “I have received
yours, containing the sad intelligence of the death of
your poor wife, and the almost simultaneous loss of
your fortune, through the failure of that rogue of a
banker. I will not, however, waste time in words of
condolence, but at once proceed to business. Well,
<i>you</i> are poor—<i>I</i> am rich; you have <i>no</i> occupation—I
have <i>too much</i>. You are young—I am getting old;
for there are many years’ difference in our ages.
Thus, in more ways than one, we may assist each
other. <i>I</i> can help you with money, and you can help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
brother Adam by employing your energies in his commercial
affairs out here in Batavia. But, as deeds are
better than words, I herewith inclose a draft, and beg
that you will, with all convenient speed, take passage
for yourself and my two nephews for this island.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Yours, my dear brother, lovingly,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Adam Blake</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S.—I am sorry to add, that I cannot offer you
and the boys a home in my house, as I am no longer
a lonely man, my chief reason for marrying again being
for the sake of my dear little Lip-lap, your niece.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Won’t it be a jolly voyage! How good of Uncle
Adam!” cried Martin.</p>

<p>“A second wife,” murmured my father, sadly, as if
pondering upon his own bereavement.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said I, “what our cousin is like, and
why Uncle calls her Lip-lap—Lip-lap, what can it
mean?”</p>

<p>“A nickname given to the children of Americans
born in Java, Claud,” answered my father.</p>

<p>“Queer,” said my brother. “But it is no matter
what they call her so that she is pretty—I like pretty
girls.”</p>

<p>“All of which we shall discover when we reach
Java,” replied our father. “But now, boys, get you
to your lessons, while <i>I</i> go to make inquiries about a
ship.”</p>

<p>“I say, Claud, won’t it be jolly? Father will be
rich again, and we shall grow up to be great merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
like Uncle Adam, and have a cousin, too,” said
Martin, merrily; but as the thought passed through
his mind that the death of our dear mother had been
caused chiefly by our father’s misfortunes, he burst
into tears. “Oh! why did God take from us poor
dear mamma? Why didn’t this letter come ever so
many months ago, and she would have lived!”</p>

<p>Heaven knew that I had felt our loss as deeply as
my brother; but for his sake, for the sake of my
father, who had never smiled since her death, and who
trembled at a word or a thing that brought it fresh
again to his memory, I had struggled to suppress any
sign of emotion at the chance mentioning of her name.
Then, throwing my arms around his neck, I said (I
believe with tears in my own eyes):</p>

<p>“Martin, it is wicked to be ever recurring to our
loss, when you know how it shocks our father. Remember,
mamma is in heaven, and happy.”</p>

<p>“I know it is wicked, but I cannot help it—I <i>won’t</i>
help it—I never <i>will</i> stop talking of dear mamma!”
and the passionate boy ran from the sitting-room into
our sleeping-chamber, and, throwing himself upon the
bed, sought relief in a good cry.</p>

<p>Since our mother’s death, such outbreaks of grief
had been common with my warm-hearted but impulsive
brother. Our uncle’s letter, however, produced
a good effect upon his mind, by directing his thoughts
to the active, perhaps adventurous, life which seemed
before us. But unfortunately we had to wait six
months before we could get a ship—a loss of time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
that, as will be seen hereafter, materially influenced
our future. Taking into account this delay, the six
months for the coming of the letter, and a similar period
for our outward voyage, it will be seen that a year
and a half elapsed between the penning of our uncle’s
invitation and our anchoring in the roadstead of Batavia.
What unexpected events, what misfortunes,
may happen in eighteen months! and they did happen.</p>

<p>Ominous, indeed, of misfortune was the night of our
arrival in the island. It was the latter end of October,
the period of the monsoons. My brother and I
were well-nigh frightened to death, most assuredly
we never expected to reach the land, for the elements
were at war. The sea rose in mountainous heights;
the horizon was spread with vast sheets of livid flame;
the thunder shook both heaven and earth; and the
wind, as it rushed inland in its fury, uprooted the
largest trees, and toppled down the huts of peasants
and the warehouses of the merchants in the lower
town. It was a mercy, indeed, that even the great
pier which forms the harbor of Batavia should have
escaped.</p>

<p>The hurricane, however, although terrible in its fury,
was but of short duration; for by daybreak we were
enabled to moor the vessel alongside the pier, and also
to procure a messenger, whom my father at once dispatched
to advise his brother of our arrival.</p>

<p>“If that is Batavia, it is a queer, dirty hole,” said
Martin, shrugging his shoulders, as he stood gazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
upon the bamboo huts of the poor natives, the warehouses
of the Dutch merchants, and the thousands of
bales of goods, covered with tarpaulin, which seemed
to block up and render the roadways impassable.</p>

<p>“Right, lad,” said the captain, who was standing
near my brother; “it <i>is</i> a queer, dirty hole. Moreover,
it is worse than it seems, for, after sunset, the vapors
and putrid exhalations, arising from the decaying vegetable
and animal matter in the marshes, where you
see yonder mangroves, render it poisonous to Americans.”</p>

<p>“And we have to live there,” said Martin, with a
shudder. “Yet,” he added, thoughtfully, “it can’t
kill everybody, for Uncle Adam has lived in it many
years.”</p>

<p>“Not so, my lad. Like the other American merchants,
your uncle quits this place every evening at
six o’clock, for his home in the upper town in yonder
mountain, where you will find large streets, a healthy
atmosphere, the Government-house and offices, the
theatre, and the grand residences of the principal
colonists.”</p>

<p>“That is good news,” said I, for I had been as nervous
as my brother at the prospect of having to live
in such a wretched place as the town before us; “but,”
I added, “where is the Chinese city, for I have heard
that those people abound in Java?”</p>

<p>“Ay, my man, the Chinese swarm in Java, as in
every island of the Indian Archipelago where money
is to be made. Their town, however, or campong, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
they term it, is situated upon the other side of the
mountain, in a spot almost as unwholesome as this.”</p>

<p>At this moment we saw our messenger, accompanied
by another native, come along the quay toward the
ship. But as the latter will prove no unimportant personage
in my narrative, I will describe his appearance.
Taller in stature than the majority of his diminutive
race, he was yet far shorter than the average height
of Americans; his complexion was a light brown; his
eyes full, black, and piercing; his hair not luxuriant,
like many of the Asiatic races, but yet not so scanty as
most of the men of Java. He was well set, and his
limbs strong and muscular, as if he had been trained
among the fishing or hunting tribes. His dress consisted
of a pair of thin cotton drawers and colored
sarong, or long plaid-like scarf, which was thrown
across the shoulder, and brought around the waist, so
as to form a sash or girdle, from which was suspended
the kris, or creese, a weapon without which no Indian
islander of whatever rank is ever seen; and but that
his upper teeth were filed and blackened, he would
have been accounted among Americans a man of no
mean personal appearance.</p>

<p>“He is a slave, or servant of your uncle’s,” said
my father. “Say,” he added, impatiently, as the man
trod the deck, “bring you letter or message from the
counselor Van Black?”</p>

<p>“My master,” he replied, bending his body forward,
while at the same time he raised his hands with the
palms joined before his face, until the thumbs touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
his nose, “I bring no letter, no message; but yet a
carriage awaits upon the quay, to convey your honor
to the house of the counselor Van Black, where, I
am bidden to say, you and your sons will find a welcome.”</p>

<p>“No message, no letter!” repeated my father, in surprise.
“It is strange that, after a parting of so many
years, Adam came not himself to welcome us. Tell
me, man,” he added, “how fares it with your master
and his family? Are they in health?”</p>

<p>“The family,” replied the native, emphasizing the
word, and making another obeisance, “are as well as
their best friends would wish them. But, craving
your pardon, Prabu is charged to convey the noble
stranger and his sons to the upper town; to do that,
and nothing more. He is a servant, and must obey.”</p>

<p>“Astounding! What can be the meaning of this?”
replied my father, thoughtfully; but finding it was of
no use to further question Prabu, as he had called himself,
he said, turning to us two boys, “Come, lads, let
us follow this fellow, for the sooner we reach my
brother’s house the sooner we shall be free from suspense.”</p>

<p>“Our uncle is ill—too ill to come or write; but
fearing to alarm you, has forbidden this man to open
his lips,” said Martin, offering the best explanation
of Prabu’s taciturnity.</p>

<p>“I fear so, indeed,” replied my father. “The greater
reason, then, that we should hasten to him; so forward,
my sons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>I had also my own fears, and an explanation to offer,
but as they passed through my mind, a chilling
sensation at my heart seemed to freeze the words, ere
they could escape my lips, and so I followed in silence
to a great, clumsy, old Dutch coach, with four Java
ponies, that was awaiting us on the quay.</p>

<p>Now, the road from the lower to the upper town is
steep and narrow. Thus, on our way we should have
been amused by the opportunity the ascent gave us of
looking at the surrounding scenery, so new to us, and
the multitude of quaintly-dressed people of all ranks,
on foot and in all descriptions of vehicles, who were
proceeding to their places of business in the wretched
city we had just quitted; but a species of melancholy
foreboding seemed to have seized upon us, which obscured
our eyes, turned our thoughts inwardly, and
reined in our tongues, for neither spoke, until the
carriage stopped before the courtyard of a large, flat-roofed
mansion in the upper town.</p>

<p>Perceiving that the gates stood open, my father, who
could no longer bridle his impatience, descended from
the carriage, telling us to follow. As we did so, Martin,
touching me on the shoulder, and speaking for the
first time since we had entered the vehicle, said:</p>

<p>“This is very queer, Claud. What do you make
of it?”</p>

<p>“Martin, I have a foreboding that something is
wrong, very wrong; calamity is in store for us; the
storm, upon our arrival last night, was ominous. Besides,
to my thinking, mystery is seated upon the mahogany-colored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
countenance of that fellow Prabu.
Look, even now how he is straining his glittering eyes
after us.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh, Claud, don’t croak; you make a fellow
shiver,” replied my brother.</p>

<p>By this time we overtook our father, at the portico
of the mansion. Here the mystery was heightened, for
no uncle stood there to welcome his relatives, but in
his place a head servant, or groom of the chamber,
who, calling my father by name, invited us to follow
him; but now, losing all patience, he rudely seized the
man by the shoulder, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Say, fellow, is my brother, your master, sick, that
I see him not here to welcome us?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied the servant, evasively, “my lady
awaits you.”</p>

<p>So saying, he threw open the doors of a large and
luxuriously furnished apartment, ushering us into the
presence of a lady of dignified demeanor, but who
seemed almost lost amid a pile of velvet cushions upon
which she was reclining, and instantly the mystery
was solved, our forebodings realized, for she was attired
in widow’s weeds.</p>

<p>“Great heaven!” exclaimed my father, “can it be
possible, then, that my brother is——”</p>

<p>“Alas! no more,” said the lady, rising and taking
his hand. “It is scarcely three months since my poor
husband died of the fever.” Then, in soft, purring
tones, like those of a cat, she added, “It was the will
of God; we may not repine. You will pardon me, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
brother, that I forebade my servants to give you this
sad news; but, out of respect to my late husband’s
memory, I desired to be the first to break to you the
sorrowful intelligence, at the same time to bid you
and your sons welcome to this house.” Then, seeing
that our father’s heart was too full of grief to reply,
she said, as she folded my brother and me, one after
the other, in her arms:</p>

<p>“These, then, are my charming nephews? Let me
embrace you, dear boys. You are noble fellows, and
shall find as good a home in this house as if your poor,
dear uncle had been saved to us.”</p>

<p>“Madam, my sister,” replied my father, “your conduct
towards us has been kind and thoughtful, still
my grief is too keen and new; craving your pardon, I
would be alone for a time.”</p>

<p>“It would have been unpardonable, my brother, had
I not foreseen this desire,” she replied, striking a small
Chinese gong suspended from the ceiling. “Go,”
she said to the servant who answered the summons,
“conduct my brother and his sons to the rooms prepared
for them.”</p>

<p>The apartments to which we were conducted were
situated in another wing of the building, upon the
ground floor, and consisted of two bedrooms and a
large sitting-room. They all had French windows
opening into the grounds, and had evidently been carefully
and thoughtfully prepared for our reception.
Leaving our parent to give full vent to his grief, for
the death of a brother to whom he had been passionately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
attached, we boys (who had never known our uncle,
and could not, therefore, so keenly feel his loss) went
to our own chamber, which, by the way, was of ample
size, and fitted up as both sitting and bedroom.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry for poor, dear uncle, though we
never saw him,” said Martin, as soon as we were
alone.</p>

<p>“I am more sorry for our father, Martin. I fear
that this fresh stroke of misfortune, coming so soon
after our dear mother’s death, will utterly destroy
his already weak health.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Claud, we boys must be his support. Then,
you know, it must be consoling even to him to find
our new aunt so kind and thoughtful.”</p>

<p>“New aunt!” I repeated; then, looking cautiously
round, and first listening to hear if footsteps were at
hand, I said, in a whisper, “Do you know, Martin,
I don’t like that woman.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you, though,” he replied, with a look of astonishment.
“But why?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know, but I don’t. You remember
the lines poor mother used to repeat to us——</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘I do not like thee, Doctor Fell,</div>
<div class="verse">The reason why, I cannot tell;</div>
<div class="verse">But this I do know, very well,</div>
<div class="verse">I do not like thee, Doctor Fell.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Claud,” replied my brother, “I am beginning to
be afraid of you; you are like a witch. But—but,”
he added, “this is foolish; it is wicked; for she is a
relation—at least, a kind of a one, you know—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
you have no reason to dislike her. But isn’t she pretty,
though?”</p>

<p>“Pretty! Well, so is a tigress, so is a serpent, and
she reminds me of both; she puts me in mind of the
portrait in that French story-book we used to read at
home, of the woman who poisoned so many husbands—just
the same plump figure, raven hair, pale skin,
dark eyes, that seem to mean everything, under an effort
to look as if they meant nothing, and soft hands;
then her embrace was as mock as a play-actor’s, nothing
real in it, and her kiss like that of Judas.”</p>

<p>“Hang it, Claud, it’s a shame; be quiet, you shall
say no more!” exclaimed my brother, placing his hand
upon my mouth. And in truth I did feel a little
ashamed of this warm expression of opinion upon so
short an acquaintance; nevertheless, I believed in it
at the time, and, moreover, that night dreamt that all
I had said had come true. But then, you know, there
is not much in dreams; at least, it is foolish to place
reliance upon them.</p>

<p>After this conversation, neither spoke for some time.
At length the silence was broken by Martin. “Claud,”
said he, “I wonder how much money our uncle has left
to father?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I fear, if our new aunt had any part
in making his will.”</p>

<p>“Oh! bother; drop talking of <i>her</i>. It’s a great
shame if he hasn’t, though, after coming all this way
by his own invitation.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall soon know all about the will, I dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
say,” said I, a little shocked that my brother should
so soon speak of money affairs; and Martin understood
and felt hurt at my thoughts, for he answered:</p>

<p>“It is for our father, who is ill, and has had so
much trouble, that I want the money, Claud, not myself;
for I am strong and healthy, and, if necessary,
shall be able to get my living somehow—for instance,
as a clerk, a messenger, a hunter, or anything, you
know, out here, where white men are valuable.”</p>

<p>“But <i>you</i>, Martin, are only a boy.”</p>

<p>“And I should like to know whether a <i>white</i> boy is
not as good as two mahogany-colored men?” he replied,
boastfully.</p>

<p>“Hush! we have been watched—listened to!” for
although I had said nothing about it to Martin, I had,
several times, while we had been conversing, heard a
rustling in the shrubbery, just outside the glass door
of our room. Hitherto, I had taken but little notice,
but now I distinctly heard a cough.</p>

<p>“Come along, then, and let us unearth the sly fox,”
whispered Martin; and the next minute we were standing
by a shrubbery near the window. Having listened
patiently for some time, and heard nothing but the
humming of birds and insects, Martin whispered:</p>

<p>“It was fancy only.”</p>

<p>“Then it was a very pretty fancy, too, for there it
is,” I replied, as at that moment I detected the eye
of the listener who had alarmed us, sparkling through
the leaves and branches; and the next instant I had
gently dragged forth one of the prettiest little girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
I had ever seen—tall and graceful in figure, with long,
flowing, golden locks; a fair complexion, tinted with
red, but just then mounting with crimson blushes; fine
blue eyes, and dimpled cheeks—indeed, a little fairy—yes,
a fairy, although she was attired in deep mourning.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t; you hurt my arm!” she exclaimed, half
pettishly, half smiling, as she struggled to escape from
my grasp.</p>

<p>“We won’t let you go; we don’t often catch real live
fairies,” said Martin. “Besides, you have half killed
us with fright.”</p>

<p>“For shame,” she replied, “for two great boys to
be frightened by a little girl like me.”</p>

<p>“You know a mouse may frighten an elephant, if
the elephant hears a strange noise and doesn’t know
that it is caused by a mouse.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” she replied, “I <i>am</i> sorry I have frightened
you both; but I am sure I could not help it; it was
that nasty cough.”</p>

<p>“But how came you to be hiding in the shrubs?
Was it to listen to what we were talking about? for
certainly you must have heard all we said.”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh! yes; that is, all <i>you</i> said,” here she whispered,
“<i>about her</i>. It was very wicked, but I won’t
tell; not I—that I won’t. But,” she added, “I couldn’t
help hearing, as I was in the shrubbery.”</p>

<p>“But what brought you there?” I asked.</p>

<p>“To get a peep at my two new cousins, of course.
I have heard so much about you from poor, dear papa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and have so long expected you to come, that when <i>she</i>
wouldn’t let me stay in the room, when you came this
morning, I cried my eyes out—at least, almost—and
then——”</p>

<p>“And then what?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“Why, I came here by myself, determined to have
a peep at you both, and uncle, too, if I could. But
hush!” she exclaimed, placing a finger upon her lips,
“I must go; I heard <span class="smcap">My Lady</span> calling for me. She
must not know that I have been here; pray don’t tell
her, or I shall be punished for disobedience;” and in
an instant she had flitted out of sight.</p>

<p>“So that is our cousin,” said Martin, when we had
returned to our room. “What a pretty girl!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I; “and so amiable, that she makes up
for our queer-tempered looking new aunt.”</p>

<p>“After all, Claud, I begin to think you are right
about ‘<span class="smcap">My Lady</span>,’ as they call her. What a shame to
punish a nice girl like that for anything!” replied
Martin.</p>

<p>And now I have told all that is worth telling of our
first day in the upper town of Batavia.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br>

<small>A GREAT CALAMITY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> my father, in his then feeble state of health, the
news of his brother’s death proved so great a shock,
that he was unable to leave his room for a whole week.
During that time, however, our aunt behaved most affectionately,
not only to the invalid and his boys, but, I
may add, to our pretty cousin Marie, her step-daughter,
with whom we were now permitted to associate
on the most cousinly terms; and, although this did not
metamorphose my dislike into love for her, it had a
great effect upon my poor father,—so great, indeed,
that, with a delicacy of feeling quite in accordance with
his nature, he awaited a full week after his recovery
before he would broach the subject of his late brother’s
will. Doubtlessly he each day expected that she herself
would open up the matter, but in this he was disappointed;
therefore he, one afternoon, but in a spasmodic
manner, as if to get the words from his lips as
speedily as possible, begged permission to see a copy
of the will; but, vexatiously enough, as she was about
to reply, the servant announced, “Mynheer Ebberfeld.”</p>

<p>My father looked annoyed; I started in my chair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
for eyes never rested upon a more ill-favored man.
“My lady,” however, seemed pleased at his coming,
for, after introducing him as the principal notary of
Batavia, and a councilor, she said:</p>

<p>“My dear brother, Mynheer Ebberfeld’s coming at
this moment is most fortunate; for, as he drew up my
late dear husband’s will, he is the most fitting person
to explain its provisions.”</p>

<p>“Your pardon, madam; your pardon, sir,” replied
the notary, with a low bow, and a simper upon his
sinister countenance, “but <i>this</i> hour, and <i>this</i> presence,
is scarcely fitting, nay, most inopportune, for business
matters; let me, therefore, crave your patience until
to-morrow, and then we will together scan the pages
of the precious document itself. In the meantime, let
me assure you that you will find its contents by no
means unsatisfactory to yourself and sons.”</p>

<p>“Nay, mynheer, my brother is naturally anxious to
become acquainted with the will, so I pray you let not
etiquette deny him that satisfaction,” said “my lady,”
with one of <i>her</i> most amiable smiles.</p>

<p>“Not so,” interposed my good-natured father;
“since Mynheer Ebberfeld deems the time, place, and
presence improper, I by no means desire him to proceed;
to-morrow will be time sufficient.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, mynheer, for your concession; a European
gentleman I felt would be too chivalrous to refuse so
reasonable a suggestion,” replied Ebberfeld.</p>

<p>Of the young people of the family, I alone had been
present during the foregoing conversation; but, at its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
close, the urbane notary, with amiable earnestness,
begged and obtained permission of the lady to invite,
“for that day only,” as the playbills have it, Marie, as
well as my brother, to a seat at the dinner table.</p>

<p>“The society of young people,” said he to my father,
“makes me feel a boy again; it is a passion with me to
see them happy. I delight in contributing my poor
share towards their amusement. Thus, my lad,” he
added, addressing me, “knowing that you have just
arrived from America, I ordered a serpent-charmer to
exhibit his tricks in the grounds after dinner; that is,
if I have madame’s permission;” and the genial smile
with which he asked, and “my lady” bowed her acquiescence
to this scheme for our benefit, for an instant
made me think I had been positively wicked in
feeling a repugnance at first sight to two such amiable
personages.</p>

<p>The dinner was served in a gorgeously decorated
pavilion in the grounds at the back of the mansion;
and, in addition to roast and boiled meats, after the
Dutch fashion, consisted of a variety of Javanese fish,
and a large dish of that famous bird’s-nest soup, of
which the Chinese have a proverb: “That if the spirit
of life were departing from the nostrils, and the odor
of this nest-soup were to salute them, the spirit would
reanimate the clay, knowing there is no luxury in
Paradise to compare with it.”</p>

<p>Assuredly, Mynheer the notary must have agreed
cordially with the proverb, for he devoured it with the
gusto of a gourmand, and was unceasing in his efforts
to press it upon us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“My lady,” he said, suddenly putting down his
spoon, “may I, nay, stretching a point, I <i>will</i> presume
to compliment you upon your cook and purveyor.
This soup is deliciously compounded; the nests must
have been of the purest white—in short, perfection.
May I ask from whence you procured them?”</p>

<p>“By means of my slave Prabu; his family are nest-hunters,
chiefly in the employ of the Chinese merchants
of the Campong. Permit me,” she added, “the
pleasure of sending a basket of them to your house.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied the notary, bending his neck so
forward, that he seemed about to stand upon his head
in his own soup-dish, “you will merit, aye, and may
command, too, my eternal gratitude; it will be as supplying
my table with a dish from Paradise.”</p>

<p>I felt shocked at this speech, for it sounded in my
ears like blasphemy, and all about a mere voluptuous
relish, by far too glutinously rich for a stomach like
mine, which had been accustomed only to plain, invigorating
food.</p>

<p>This dish, so precious in the far East, is compounded
of—first, the nest of the swallow (<i>Hirundo esculenta</i>),
which, when dissolved, is like a brown jelly or melted
glue, the sinews of deer, the feet of pigs, the fins of
young sharks, and the brawny part of a pig’s head,
all mixed together with plover’s eggs, mace, cinnamon,
and red pepper.</p>

<p>“Pray let me help you to some of this most delicious
of earthly delicacies, this soup of Paradise,” said the
epicure, to my father and brother, both of whom had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
already exhibited their disgust at the precious mixture.
My father politely declined. As for Martin, he spoke
plainly:</p>

<p>“Thank you, no; I don’t like the nasty mess; but I
just should like to go upon one expedition with this
Prabu and his brother nest-hunters, wouldn’t <i>you</i>,
Claud?”</p>

<p>“All in good time, young gentlemen, you will grow
to idolize this rare dish,” said Ebberfeld; adding in
his oily tones, “As for nest-hunting, for which you
express such a desire, with your worthy parent’s permission,
I will undertake to find you an opportunity;
for a love of enterprise is a good sign in the young.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, it will be rare sport,” replied Martin.</p>

<p>After the dinner, we removed to a large tent erected
upon a spacious lawn, to witness the tricks of the
snake-charmer. Martin, Marie, and I sat upon the
grass, our seniors on couches upon the opposite side of
the tent.</p>

<p>There were two performers—the snake-charmer, an
old man, who, once seen, could never be forgotten, for
not only had he a huge hump upon his back, but a
wen upon his neck, so large, that it seemed to be outgrowing
his head, which it pushed upon his right
shoulder; the other was his attendant, a boy, rather
good-looking than otherwise, for a Javanese peasant.</p>

<p>Marie, having frequently witnessed this man’s performance,
looked on now with nonchalance, but Martin
and I strained our eyes to the utmost, towards a
large box which the old man began to open, as soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the boy commenced playing upon a native fife or flute.
At the sound of the instrument, the lid of the box being
now removed, the hooded head of a spectacled
snake raised its crest about a foot above the side, at
first languidly, though gracefully, and as if listening
to the music; but when the boy played a more lively
air, the beautiful reptile moved its head and neck fantastically,
as if endeavoring to keep time. After some
five minutes, the old man, baring one of his arms,
knelt by the side of the box, when, I supposed at the
time, because the boy happened to discontinue the
music, the neck of the reptile became swollen, and in
an instant it had fixed its fangs upon the man’s arm.</p>

<p>Up jumped Martin, crying, “The poor old man will
be killed!” and in another second he would have
grasped the snake; but simultaneously Marie seized
his hands, and, with a strength lent to her by terror
alone, dragged him back.</p>

<p>“Foolish cousin!” she exclaimed; “had you approached
one step nearer the cobra, you would not
have lived out the day.”</p>

<p>A <i>cobra</i>! How my heart sickened at the name.
That beautiful snake was, then, the reptile of whose
deadly bite I had heard and read so much.</p>

<p>As for Martin, ever fearless of harm to himself when
another was in danger, he struggled to escape from
Ebberfeld, who had now come to the assistance of our
cousin, exclaiming frenzily:</p>

<p>“The poor old man will be killed, I tell you. See,
the blood is pouring from his arm! Drive away the
snake!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“Foolish boy,” replied mynheer; “remain where you
are; that old man is the cobra’s master. It is by these
tricks he lives. What is play to him would be death
to you.”</p>

<p>This explanation quieted my brother, and made him
laugh; but speedily our attention was turned in another
direction: our brave cousin, overcome by her exertions
or terror at my brother’s narrow escape, had
swooned.</p>

<p>“How vexatious!” cried our aunt. “Go,” she added
to Prabu, the slave, who had just entered the tent with
some message, “carry the foolish girl to her maid.”</p>

<p>What a feeling arose in my heart at these words.
As for Martin, with flashing eyes, he said, savagely,
“Foolish—she is not foolish; she is as brave and good
as an angel. It is you who are wicked.”</p>

<p>“Martin!” exclaimed our father, sternly, reproachfully;
and although in a storm of passion, habitual obedience
to a beloved parent at once silenced my brother.
Better, perhaps, had he been permitted to give vent to
his almost justifiable wrath, for feelings akin to hatred
seized upon his heart, never to be removed; but, then,
in his behalf, I must admit that other matters arose
afterwards to fan the flame.</p>

<p>This mishap broke up the party, but, most vexatiously
to my brother and me, our father, taking us to
his own apartments, detained us with him the rest of
the day, for fear that Martin, while in his angry mood,
should come in contact with “my lady.” “For with
your aunt, Martin,” he said, “I would not now trust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
you alone. Your hasty temper would probably lead
you into some disrespectful act, that might be of material
injury to your future prospects, for as yet we
know not to what extent she may have power over us
all. To-morrow I shall not be so ignorant, for then
I intend to examine my poor brother’s will.”</p>

<p>“Bother the will and the money, too,” replied Martin,
hastily, “if they are to prevent a fellow from defending
those who have saved his life. Besides, father,
I want to know whether cousin Marie has recovered.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, my dear boy, you are a noble fellow,
but with a temper that may get you into difficulties if
not kept in check. As for your cousin, rest contented;
she is well by this time. It was only a fainting-fit.”</p>

<p>“But, father, I want to <i>know</i> that, or I sha’n’t sleep
a wink.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” replied my father. “Rest contented till
the morning; but now get you to your own room, for
it is time all honest people were in bed.”</p>

<p>We obeyed, but not to sleep; our minds were too
full of <i>the</i> event of the day, our anxiety too great about
our cousin. For an hour or two, indeed, till darkness
(which comes so suddenly in the East) had set in, we
sat pondering, when Martin said, “I won’t go to bed
until I know whether our cousin has recovered, and
that’s flat.”</p>

<p>“But how are we to find out?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you, Claud. Marie’s room is in the other
wing, just above the verandah; her window is within
a yard of the fig-tree, and overlooks the garden. Let
us go there. I will ascend the tree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Well, and what then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why, I will throw some pebbles at the panes. If
she is well, it will arouse her; she will show herself,
and I shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I don’t half like the plan,” said I; “we may
frighten her into another fainting-fit.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, Claud. All I want to know is,
whether you will go with me.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I say no.”</p>

<p>“Then I will go by myself, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, we will go together.”</p>

<p>The night was of pitchy darkness; so far, so good.
We could creep by the very walls without being observed,
should any inmate still be about. Having
reached the fig-tree, Martin began to make its ascent;
but the trunk was so smooth, and the lowest branch
so high, that it was beyond his reach. To remedy that
difficulty, however, I stood against the tree, while he
clambered on to my shoulders, and by that means just
managed to grasp the first branch. As soon as I felt
myself relieved from his weight, I began to tremble
(I am a bit of a coward, or, at least, compared with
Martin, a little nervous), in fear that a false step, or
the rustling of the leaves, might arouse some restless
sleeper; and he <i>did</i> make a false step, and, by so doing,
such a noise, that I felt certain we should be discovered;
but he persevered, and when he had reached
the branch nearly level with our cousin’s window, as
had previously been arranged between us, he signalized
the same by dropping a few pebbles upon my head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Then, with a beating heart, I listened. Pat, pat, pat,
against the panes went three pebbles, but no answer.
Others were then thrown, but still no answer. A third
time he pebbled the panes, and successfully, for I could
distinctly hear the French windows open. “Marie is
aroused at last,” I muttered; but no! if so, Martin
would have spoken; but for a few minutes there was a
dead silence; then (oh, didn’t I feel as if I should like
to have shrunk down within my own shoes), I heard
our aunt’s voice calling to a slave to bring lights. How
provoking! my brother, after all, had mistaken our
aunt’s room for Marie’s. What would be the consequences?
surely they would detect him when the lights
came? or if not, believing thieves were about the
premises, would arouse the household; then, not daring
to call to him, I despaired. Fortunately, however,
not losing <i>his</i> presence of mind, the next minute he
had slidden quietly down the smooth trunk.</p>

<p>“Bother!” he whispered in my ear. “What a muff
I must have been to have made such a mistake! But
come, Claud, let us hide among the bushes, and perhaps
they will think we were old Boreas.”</p>

<p>For a short time we stood stock-still among the
shrubs and trees; then, believing our aunt had recovered
from her alarm, we moved, creeping softly, in an
opposite direction to the house, so that, should any
person or persons be on the lookout, we might escape
them; but by so doing, in those large and intricately
laid out grounds, after an hour’s ramble we had literally
lost ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“What shall we do now?” asked my brother, coming
to a dead halt.</p>

<p>“Remain where we are till daybreak, when there
will be light enough to show us the way back to our
room,” said I.</p>

<p>“All right, old fellow,” he replied, coolly; “we have
no alternative; in the meantime, let us make ourselves
at home;” and he threw himself at full length upon a
piece of green sward.</p>

<p>“Stay, Martin,” I said; “there is a glimmer yonder;
surely it cannot be a glow-worm.”</p>

<p>“A glow-worm,” he repeated; “nonsense! It is the
light from a lantern. Queer! who can be there at this
time? let us see.”</p>

<p>As we approached the light, we found it proceeded
from a small grotto-like hut, which we perceived to
be within a few yards of the window of our room.</p>

<p>“This is lucky, for we know where we are; but
before we go in, let us see what’s doing at this time of
night; something wrong, I am sure. Stay,” he added,
as we reached the walls; “can’t you hear voices?”</p>

<p>Martin was right; we could hear voices, very distinctly,
too, and in anger; one was that of the slave,
Prabu, the other the old snake-charmer’s.</p>

<p>“Well, well, old man,” Prabu was saying, in reply
to something the other man had said, but which we had
not heard; “you have explained <i>why</i> I find you in the
grotto, but if my lady <i>has</i> condescendingly permitted
you to remain here, it was not good that you should
keep a light through the night to frighten honest people
out of their wits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Worthy Prabu, I am old, and require luxuries that
the young, strong and handsome, like thyself, find not
necessary.”</p>

<p>“It may be so; yet, Huccuck, thou art more than
suspected of being a rogue; still, if the light helps thee
to keep the venomous reptiles in your box from escaping,
it may remain; but as you value your liberty, get
thee hence before daybreak, for such are my lady’s orders.”</p>

<p>So saying, to our great relief, the slave quitted the
hut. Having allowed him sufficient time to get beyond
earshot, we found our way to our own room, when,
notwithstanding our heroic resolutions not to close
our eyes till we had seen or heard of Marie, we were
speedily in the arms of Somnus.</p>

<p>“Claud! Claud! old fellow, awake; get up, there is
such a to-do!” cried Martin, early the next morning,
at the same time that he pulled one of my ears.</p>

<p>“Bother, don’t,” I replied, only half-awakened, but
wholly vexed at being disturbed.</p>

<p>“That brute of a snake has escaped from its box and
the old hunchback.”</p>

<p>“It is no concern of ours. Serves old Huc—what’s
his name?—right, for not being more careful.” And
I turned round to sleep again.</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i> a concern of ours, and may serve <i>us</i>
wrong, or any one else in whose room or way it may
happen to come. For shame, Claud! get up! See, I
am more than half-dressed.”</p>

<p>Now fully aroused, for he had tugged at both ears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
I jumped out of bed; and, hastily putting on my
clothes, ran into the grounds with my brother. There
was indeed “a to-do,” as Martin had called it.</p>

<p>The hunchback, moaning and wailing for the loss
of his dear friend and companion, the partner in his
means of obtaining a livelihood, and around or near to
him the servants and slaves of the household, males
and females, armed with garden implements, sticks—anything,
indeed, upon which they could place their
hands. Terror-stricken, and every now and then looking
behind, as if they expected to find the reptile at
their very heels, they were listening to the tale of the
serpent’s escape, or offering advice as to the means of
its recapture. Prabu came up a minute after us, and
seeing that, while all were talking, not one seemed inclined
to act, he cried to the men:</p>

<p>“Dogs and sons of dogs, stand not here like frightened
curs! distribute yourselves about the grounds;
search every corner; examine every hole and bush.”
But still none moved until “my lady,” coming forward
and stamping her foot upon the earth, cried angrily,
“Get ye gone; do as you are bid. The man who kills
the reptile shall have the weight of its head in gold.”</p>

<p>At this the poltroons scampered off, all but Prabu
and the hunchback, who, addressing the lady in
piteous, whining tones, cried, “Not <i>kill</i>, dear lady;
not <i>kill</i>. You would not deprive a wretched old man
of his daily rice.”</p>

<p>“Get you gone, wretch! join in the search; and,
mark me, heartily shall you be punished if, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
your carelessness, harm happens to any one in this
house.”</p>

<p>“Come, Martin,” said I, “let us look for a stick or
a fork, and help to find the reptile.”</p>

<p>“Not so, boys; it is needless that you should incur
danger. Get you back into the house.”</p>

<p>“True, aunt,” said Martin; “but let us to our
father’s room.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed “my lady,” with a start of
alarm; but, recalling her words quickly, she continued,
“Yes, to your father’s room, if you will; but better to
your own, for he is ill, and it will be cruel to disturb
him.”</p>

<p>“My lady, I will search all the rooms which open
into the grounds; the reptile may have crept into one
of them,” said Prabu.</p>

<p>Those words frightened me. “Then our father’s
first, good Prabu,” I said; “for he sleeps with his door
open.”</p>

<p>In another minute, without ceremony, we had passed
through the French windows of our father’s sleeping-room.
The bed was at the other end, and our parent,
covered with a mosquito curtain, appeared to be sleeping
undisturbed by the hubbub.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven, our father is safe!” I exclaimed;
but scarcely had the words left my lips, when I
stumbled—nay, fell—putting forth one hand to save
myself. Imagine my horror to find it upon the cold,
clammy skin of the reptile. It lifted its crest, and put
forth its fang with a hiss; but, luckily, Prabu was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
my heels: for, as the hiss issued from its jaws, his glittering
creese at one blow divided its head from its
body. But an instant after I envied the reptile its
death-wound. A wild, prolonged shriek from Martin
proclaimed the saddest incident of my life. <i>Our parent
was dead.</i></p>

<p>“The poor Sahib! my poor young master!” cried
Prabu, looking upon the bed. “It is the cobra’s bite.”</p>

<p>“No, not dead! say not dead, good Prabu! Send
for a doctor; my father may have swooned; he cannot
be dead!” I cried, giving way to the wildest grief.</p>

<p>But my brother’s conduct surprised me. He, so
passionate, so impulsive, after his first outburst of
agony, said not a word. For a few minutes he stared
wildly in our parent’s face, then, throwing himself
upon the body and embracing him, he prayed of him to
awake; but, seeming to have realized the truth, he exclaimed,
“My father has been murdered! I will kill
that hunchback!” and snatching the creese out of
Prabu’s hand, he darted off towards the spot where we
had left the snake-charmer; but the fellow had fled,
mysteriously fled. Almost bereft of his senses by
grief, Martin rushed into the presence of our aunt.</p>

<p>“Wicked woman!” he exclaimed, “it is <i>you</i> who
have killed my father.”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush! my dear boy,” she replied, kindly,
affectionately, taking his hand and drawing him towards
her; “you must not say such words; but I
wonder not, for this great calamity has well-nigh deprived
me of my senses. It is terrible, very terrible;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
but, my dear boy, you must not give way to this wild
grief, it will kill you. Come, come,” and she ran her
soft white hand through his chestnut locks. Still,
notwithstanding her affectionate manner, apparent
grief at my father’s death, her expressed indignation
at the hunchback, and the large sum she offered for
his apprehension (although, except for carelessness,
for what crime he was to be apprehended I could not
imagine), she did not succeed in winning our love.
Nay, even if we had not at the first entertained a kind
of instinctive dislike to her, we, who had been brought
up under the eye of an American mother, could never
have been brought to respect, not to say <i>love</i>, “my
lady.” Her habits, her behavior to her slaves and
servants, were repugnant to our feelings. Of these
habits and ways the reader may judge from the following
sketch of the class of which she was to the full
a representative:—</p>

<p>“The lip-lap ladies, <i>i. e.</i>, natives of Batavia, are of a
listless and lazy temperament, not quitting their beds till
about half-past seven or eight o’clock (a late hour in
the East). They spend the forenoon in laughing,
talking, and playing with their female slaves, who,
perhaps, a few minutes afterwards, they will have
whipped most unmercifully for the merest trifle. The
greater portion of the day, attired in a cool, airy dress,
they lounge upon sofas or sit upon the ground, with
their legs crossed under them, chewing betel—a habit
with which, like most Indian women, they are infatuated.
Not content with this, they masticate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Java tobacco, which evil practice encrimsons the
saliva, and in time fringes their lips with a black border,
and causes their teeth to become black; the great
excuse for the use of the betel being that it purifies
the mouth, and preserves them from the toothache.
To do them justice, these ladies are really not deficient
in powers of understanding, and would become very
useful members of society, endearing wives and good
mothers, if they were but kept from familiarity with
the slaves in their infancy, and educated under the
immediate eye of their parents, who should be assiduous
to inculcate in their tender minds the principles
of true morality and polished manners. But,
alas! the parents are far from taking such a burdensome
task upon themselves. As soon as the child is
born, they abandon it to the care of a female slave,
by whom it is reared, till it attains the age of nine or
ten years. These nurses, being most frequently but
one remove above brutes in intellect, instil into the
minds of their charges prejudices and superstitions,
which, increasing as they grow to maturity, seem to
stamp them rather as the progeny of half-witted, mischievous
slaves, than of civilized beings.</p>

<p>“In common with most of the women in India,
they are excessively jealous of their husbands and
of their female slaves; and upon the slightest pretext,
they will have these poor bondswomen whipped with
rods and beaten with rattans till they sink down before
them nearly exhausted. Among other methods of torturing,
they make the poor girls sit before them in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
such a posture that they can pinch them with their
toes, with such cruel ingenuity that they faint away
from excess of pain. Yet are these lip-lap ladies
much sought after by the Dutch colonists for wives;
for as soon as one of them becomes a widow, and the
body of her husband is interred (which is generally
done the day after his decease), she has immediately
a number of suitors.</p>

<p>“Their dress is very light and airy. They have a
piece of cotton cloth wrapped round the body, and fastened
under the arms next to the skin; over it they
wear a jacket and a chintz petticoat, which is all covered
by a long gown, or <i>kabay</i>, as it is called, which
hangs loose; the sleeves come down to the wrists,
where they are fastened close, with six or seven little
gold or diamond buttons. When they go out in
state, or to a company where they expect the presence
of a lady of a councilor of India, they put on a
very fine muslin <i>kabay</i>. They all go with their heads
uncovered. The hair, which is perfectly black, is worn
in a wreath, fastened with gold and diamond hair-pins,
which they call a <i>condé</i>. In the front, and on
the sides of the head, it is stroked smooth, and rendered
shining by being anointed with cocoa-nut oil.</p>

<p>“They are particularly partial to this head-dress,
and the girl who can arrange their hair the most to
their liking is the chief favorite among their slaves.
On Sundays they sometimes dress in the European
style, with stays and other fashionable incumbrances,
which, however, they do not like at all, being accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
to an attire so much looser and more pleasant
in this torrid clime.</p>

<p>“When a lady goes out, she has usually four or
more female slaves attending her, one of whom bears
her betel-box. They are sumptuously adorned with
gold and silver, and this ostentatious luxury the Indian
ladies carry to a very great excess.</p>

<p>“The title of ‘My lady’ is given exclusively to the
wives of councilors of India. The ladies are very fond
of riding through the streets of the town in their carriages
in the evening. Formerly, when Batavia was in
a more flourishing condition, they were accompanied
by musicians; but this is little customary at present—no
more than rowing through the canals that intersect
the town in little pleasure-boats: and the going upon
these parties, which were equally enlivened by music,
was called <i>orangbayen</i>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>OUR UNCLE’S LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I must</span> now, as rapidly as possible, sketch the events
of two years—events that led to our becoming wanderers
in the wilds of Java. Well, about a month after
our father’s funeral, the notary, Ebberfeld, read to us
the will. By that testament, Uncle Adam had divided
his fortune, including money, merchandise, houses—indeed,
everything he had possessed—into two portions;
the one to go absolutely to his daughter Marie,
upon her reaching the age of twenty-one, the second
to be divided equally between the widow and his
brother. It was also willed that should Marie die unmarried,
and the widow be survivor, that her portion
should go to the latter. Further, ran the document,
“Should my brother outlive my wife, then her share
shall go to him; or, in the event of his demise, to his
sons: but if my wife outlive my brother and his
sons, Claud and Martin, then the portion of the latter
shall pass absolutely to her.” It was further willed,
that should our father die before the youngest of us
boys reached the age of twenty-one, then the widow
was to become our guardian.</p>

<p>“Uncle has been very good to us, Claud,” said Martin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the first moment we were alone after hearing the
will read; “but I would rather be my own master without
the money, than be under her guardianship, and
have twice as much.”</p>

<p>“Why, Martin, I thought that, like me, you had
begun to like our aunt?”</p>

<p>“Well, not to <i>like</i> her, but not to <i>dis</i>like her so much.
However, that is neither here nor there; we sha’n’t be
under <i>her</i> guardianship, but under that of Ebberfeld.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Martin! what can he have to do with
us?”</p>

<p>“Everything, for he will marry her, and so be <i>her</i>
master and <i>ours</i>.”</p>

<p>“How could you dream of such a thing, Martin?”</p>

<p>“I did not <i>dream</i> it, Claud. Is it probable that <i>I</i>
should dream of such a man at all? Nevertheless, I
<i>know</i> it. Prabu told me so.”</p>

<p>“Worse and worse,” said I, laughing. “Is it likely
a slave should be acquainted with his mistress’s private
affairs?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” replied my brother, triumphantly; “and for
a very good reason. ‘My lady’ has promised him his
liberty papers upon the day of her marriage. Now,
will you believe it?”</p>

<p>There was no reason I should not believe it, for our
aunt would not be the first widow who had married
again; but so unpalatable was the idea of being under
Ebberfeld’s guardianship, that I <i>tried</i> to disbelieve it.
It mattered but little, however, what I believed or disbelieved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
for married they were, within a month after
that conversation; and from the time of that ceremony
we dated the two most miserable years of our lives.</p>

<p>Mynheer Ebberfeld, the oily-tongued notary, the patron
of young people, proved to be a domestic tyrant
of the first water. His word was law, and a Draconic
law, too, to all but “my lady” and, strange to say,
Prabu. Of the first he was very proud; for although
her father was a Dutchman, she was descended by the
mother’s side from the <i>Susunans</i>, or ancient sovereigns
of Java, and cousin-german to a rich Japanese pangeran,
or prince. Himself a half-caste, Mynheer had
hitherto, although very rich, been held but in small
esteem by the colonists; his marriage, however, rendered
him so important in his own estimation, that he
became the most arrogant man in the island. But arrogant,
exacting, avaricious, tyrannical as he was,
Prabu seemed to care but little for him—nay, with
such nonchalance did the freed slave treat both master
and mistress (for he was still, after a manner, in
their service), that at times I used to think he was
in possession of some secret that placed them in his
power.</p>

<p>To Marie, my brother, and me, this man was more
hateful for his tyranny to his slaves, than for any overt
acts to ourselves. But I will relate a tragedy that
occurred within the first twelve months of his marriage
through his brutality, and you may then judge for
yourselves the kind of man we had for guardian.</p>

<p>Ebberfeld possessed an estate some ten miles from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the upper town. Upon this was a family of slaves,
consisting of a man, his wife, and three children, all
natives of Bugis, one of the wildest of the Indian islands.
The man, although of a race noted for its ferocity,
had ever been hard-toiling, docile, and gentle, and,
moreover, passionately attached to his wife and children.
It was the latter most amiable passion that
caused the poor fellow’s ruin, for he became goaded
to madness by the wanton cruelty of Ebberfeld to those
dear relatives. Unable to witness this brutality any
longer, he ran “a muck” among those he so dearly
loved, resolved to release them from their sufferings—that
is, he slew mother and children with his creese;
then, throwing the weapon into a neighboring canal,
he ran till he met two Dutch merchants, to whom he
surrendered himself, begging that they would kill
him.</p>

<p>Now, such is the spirit of revenge, the impatience of
restraint, and the repugnance to submit to insults, in the
breasts of all the Indian islanders, that these “mucks,”
or murders, are of frequent occurrence; and if the perpetrator
survive, he is invariably punished with a disgraceful
death; but in this case, the Governor-General
not only pardoned the poor fellow, in consideration
of the fearful provocation he had had, but severely
reprimanded Ebberfeld for his wanton cruelty, and,
moreover, deprived him of an office of importance to
which he had recently been appointed. Deeply resenting
the pardoning of a slave that had caused him so
great a loss, and perhaps more so the deprivation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
his appointment, Mynheer took to courses which led
to his ultimate ruin, and that is why I have related this
tragedy. But a few words about this peculiar form of
revenge, which, although unknown to other people, is
yet universal in the Indian islands.</p>

<p>“To run a muck,” says Dr. Johnson, “signifies to
run madly, and attack all that we meet.” “A muck”
among the Indian islanders means, generally, an act
of desperation, in which the individual or individuals
devote their lives, with few or no chances of success,
for the gratification of their revenge. Sometimes it is
confined to the individual who has offered the injury;
at other times it is indiscriminate, and the enthusiast,
with a total aberration of reason, assails the guilty and
the innocent. On other occasions, again, the oppressor
escapes, and the muck consists in the oppressed
party’s taking the lives of those dearest to him, and
then his own, that, as in the instance of Ebberfeld’s
slave, they and he may be freed from some insupportable
oppression and cruelty.</p>

<p>The most frequent mucks, by far, are those in which
the desperado assails indiscriminately friend and foe,
and in which, with disheveled hair and frantic look,
he murders or wounds all he meets without distinction,
until he be himself killed, falls exhausted by loss of
blood, or is secured by the application of certain forked
instruments, with which experience has suggested the
necessity of opposing those who run a muck, and with
which, therefore, the officers of police are always furnished.
One of the most singular circumstances attending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
these acts of criminal desperation is the apparently
unpremeditated, and always the sudden and
unexpected, manner in which they are undertaken.
The desperado discovers his intention neither by his
gestures, his speech, nor his features; and the first
warning is the drawing of the creese, the wild shout
which accompanies it, and the commencement of the
work of death. In 1814, a chief of Celebes surrendered
himself to the British and a party of their allies
headed by a chief. He was disarmed and placed under
a guard, in a comfortable habitation, and the hostile
chief kept him company during the night. His creese
was lying on a table at a little distance from him.
About twelve o’clock at night, while engaged in conversation,
he suddenly started from his seat, ran to his
weapon, and, having possessed himself of it, attempted
to assassinate his companion, who, having superior
strength, returned a mortal stab.</p>

<p>The retainers of the prisoner, who were without,
hearing what was going on within, attacked those of
the friendly chief and the European sentinels with
great courage, and would have mastered them, had not
the officer of the guard rushed out with his drawn
sword, and overpowered those who were engaged with
them. When he entered the apartment where the chiefs
were, he found the captive chief expiring, leaning on
the arm and supported by the knee of his opponent,
who, with his drawn dagger over him, waited to give,
if necessary, an additional stab.</p>

<p>In the year 1812, the very day on which the fortified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
palace of the Sultan of Java was stormed, a certain
petty chief, a favorite of the dethroned Sultan, was one
of the first to come over to the conquerors, and was
active, in the course of the day, in carrying into effect
the successful measures pursued for the pacification
of the country. At night he was, with many other
Javanese, hospitably received into the spacious house
of the chief of the Chinese, and appeared to be perfectly
satisfied with the new order of things. The house was
protected by a strong guard of Sepoys. At night,
without any warning, but starting from his sleep, he
commenced havoc, and before he had lost his own life,
killed and wounded a great number of persons, chiefly
his countrymen, who were sleeping in the same apartment.</p>

<p>Now, to Mynheer, as to all arrogant, overbearing
men, honor and position were as the breath of life to
his nostrils. Thus, the loss of his appointment made
him morose and taciturn, and for hours together he
would sit communing with himself, like one meditating
some deep-laid scheme.</p>

<p>Then, strange to relate, Prabu seemed to have been
taken into his confidence; for they would occasionally
sit together in close conference in the library. Again,
the twain would disappear for a week or two at a time—Prabu,
as he would tell us, to go “nest-hunting”
on his own account for the Chinese merchants of the
Campong, and Ebberfeld to accompany him, for the
love of the excitement and the benefit of his health.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said my brother, after having heard this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
“it is all very well for Prabu to tell us that story; but
it is fudge. It is my opinion they are hatching some
conspiracy against the Government.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I replied, “that is a very romantic explanation
of the mystery, at all events;” but then I
did not, of course, believe anything so improbable, for,
although there could be little doubt that our guardian
was bad enough for anything, I did not give him
credit for brains or pluck enough to take so high a
flight in his wickedness; neither did Martin any longer
entertain that belief when, one day, that grandee, the
Javanese pangeran, or prince, came to our house to
remain on a few weeks’ visit, and for a very good reason.
His mahogany-colored highness was on terms
of amity with the Dutch Government; for, although
the latter had deprived him of <i>sovereign</i> power, as an
equivalent they paid him a large annual stipend, and
permitted him to retain his estates as proprietor.</p>

<p>“There can be little doubt,” I said, “that the Prince
would <i>like</i> to exterminate the conquerors of his race,
and, like his ancestors, establish barbaric rule over
the island; but, then, it is not possible, and he is not
mad enough to attempt impossibilities. It would be to
resign the substance for the shadow.”</p>

<p>“True, Claud; but then, if there be truth in history,
vanity, revenge, and ambition have caused many
a man to give up his <i>one</i> bird in hand for a chance
of catching the <i>two</i> in the bush.”</p>

<p>“But look you, brother Martin; it is no business of
ours, and I vote we don’t bother ourselves about it.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” replied Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Now we both honestly intended to keep to this agreement,
and to trouble our heads with our own affairs
alone; but fate would have it otherwise.</p>

<p>A few days after the foregoing conversation, as my
brother and I were sitting at our studies in the apartment
which had been originally our father’s, but which
we had occupied since his death, Marie came running
into the room with tears in her eyes, and looking the
very picture of terror.</p>

<p>“Cousin Claud! cousin Martin!” she cried, “that
wicked, wicked man!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Marie? why are you so frightened?”
asked Martin.</p>

<p>“Enough to make one frightened—that bad man is
going to kill us all—you, Claud, and poor me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Marie. <i>Kill</i> us, indeed! What for?”
said I, laughing.</p>

<p>“To get the money my father left us in his will.
You know it goes to <i>her</i>, if we all die first.”</p>

<p>“This is indeed foolish, you silly girl,” said Martin.
“What can he want with our money? Why, he is as
rich as Crœsus.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she replied, “that is no matter; he wants
more than he has of his own, and that grand but
wicked-looking Prince wants it, too. But listen, and I
will tell you how I found it all out. You must know,”
she added, in whispered tones, “that Cæsar” (a favorite
dog) “and I were having a game of romps,
when suddenly he scampered into Mynheer Ebberfeld’s
private garden, which, you know, he has forbidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
either of us to enter. Well, not dreaming that
Mynheer was there, indeed, quite thoughtlessly, I ran
after Cæsar, and found myself close to the pavilion
before I knew where I was. Then, hearing two voices—those
of the Prince and Mynheer—I could not help
going near, quite near, to the woodwork—”</p>

<p>“And listening,” said Martin. “Had you forgotten
the fate of Bluebeard’s wives?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am coming to something quite as bad,” she
replied. “The Prince, I suppose, must have been asking
for money, for I heard Mynheer tell him that he
had already either mortgaged or sold nearly all his
private property, and he did not think he could supply
any more. ‘But,’ said the Prince, ‘old Adam Black
must have left a very large fortune; for he was one
of the richest men in Java.’ ‘True,’ answered Mynheer;
‘but one half is left to the chit (“fancy now his
calling <i>me</i> a chit!” she interposed, angrily) of a girl,
his daughter; the other half he divided between my
wife and the father of the two boys, his nephews.’”</p>

<p>“Well, well, go on, Marie,” said I, now all curiosity.</p>

<p>“Then the Prince said, quite coolly, ‘Well, Mynheer,
have not you, in right of your wife, as the guardian
of these youngsters, any control over the money?’
‘None, Prince,’ replied Mynheer. ‘True,’ he added;
‘were the girl in legal possession of her fortune, we
might make her marry your highness.’”</p>

<p>“The rogue!” exclaimed Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes, cousin, that was a pretty speech, wasn’t it?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
she said; “but don’t interrupt me. Well, to this the
Prince made some scornful reply about he, a descendant
of the ancient Susunans, marrying a Dutch trader’s
daughter, the whole of which I did not catch; and the
moment after he said, ‘But in the event of the death
of this girl and the boys, Mynheer, to <i>whom</i> would
the money go?’ ‘To my wife; but that, in fact,
means your humble servant, for she is as warmly
interested in the success of our plans as your highness
and myself,’ he replied. ‘In that case, the difficulty
lies in a nutshell, which may be easily cracked,’ replied
the Prince. But after that I could hear no more,
for they spoke in whispers; but I have no doubt they
were hatching some plot to kill us all three.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Marie,” I said; “they are bad men, but
would not dare kill us. Why, it would be murder.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about not daring!” cried Martin.
“It is, at all events, fortunate that we are now on our
guard; but, Marie, did you hear no more—nothing
that might give us a clue to their mysterious doings?”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Martin,” I interposed; “mention no
names, you may be overheard.” But my caution was
too late; for scarcely had Marie uttered the words,
“Yes, yes, I know their wicked designs,” than Mynheer
himself stalked through the opened windows into
the room, and, taking her by the arm, said, sternly,
“Come, girl, come, what falsehoods are you telling?
what mischief are you three hatching together?”</p>

<p>“She is telling no falsehood; as for mischief, it is
more likely to be you who are hatching it than Marie!”
exclaimed Martin, savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Silence, boy, or I will have you punished,” replied
Mynheer, fiercely; and without another word he left,
taking our cousin with him.</p>

<p>“That man overheard all Marie told us,” I said.</p>

<p>“I pray Heaven no, Claud,” replied my brother. “If
he did, many will be the days ere we shall be permitted
to see her again, except, at least, in <i>his</i> or <i>her</i>
presence. I tell you, brother,” he added, “if it were
not for leaving Marie in Ebberfeld’s power, I should
vote for at once laying our heads together to run from
here.”</p>

<p>“I am of the same opinion; but where could we go?”
said I.</p>

<p>“Anywhere. To the sea, to the woods, or, if Prabu
would take us with him, ‘nest-hunting.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

<small>THE ROBBERY AND ABDUCTION OF MARIE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A fortnight</span> had elapsed since Mynheer had taken
Marie from our room. His Javanese highness had left
about a week, and we had been kept from both sight
and speech with our cousin, an exclusion that much
vexed us. It was night, and my brother and I, while
undressing for bed, were speculating as to the possibility
of eluding our guardian’s vigilance.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Claud,” said Martin, as he stepped
into bed, “I <i>will</i> see Marie, if I die for it—aye, and
talk to her, too.”</p>

<p>“A brave resolution; but how? We have been
making the effort a whole fortnight, and as yet have
not even discovered in what part of the house she is
confined.”</p>

<p>“Let me sleep upon it, and I will tell you in the
morning,” replied Martin, and not another word could
I get from him, so I also endeavored to “sleep upon it;”
but after a couple of hours, finding that I was still
restless, and my eyes would not keep closed, I arose,
and, as it was a bright moonlight night, determined
to stroll about the grounds. Scarcely, however, had I
stepped out, than I fancied I could hear footfalls, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the murmuring of whispering voices. Alarmed, for,
whoever they were, they could not be there for any
honest purpose, I crept into the shrubbery, where we
had first discovered Marie, and from thence, by the
light of the moon, saw four half-naked natives, each
with a glittering creese by his side, approaching the
window; but guess my astonishment when, in the one
who was evidently their leader, I recognized the hunchback
snake-charmer, the man whom my brother and I
both regarded as the <i>cause</i> of our father’s death. My
first impulse was to rush forward and seize the fellow
by the throat, my second to shout to Martin; but an
instant’s reflection showed me that either would be an
act of madness, and I determined to raise an alarm
<i>only</i> in the event of their attempting to harm my
brother.</p>

<p>Then I began to ponder what could be their object—perhaps
to murder or kidnap us boys; for Marie’s
story about Ebberfeld, and the advantages he would
derive from our death, was vivid in my memory. But
no; they were ordinary vulgar robbers, without the
least embellishment of romance, for the repulsive little
wen-necked hunchback, taking a handful of earth
from a bag suspended round his neck, threw it scatteringly
into the room. “Good,” he said to his companions;
“it fell upon their beds; they will sleep till
the morning.”</p>

<p>It was by that act I knew them to be only common
robbers, for in Java those worthies entertain a superstition
that if a quantity of earth from a <i>newly-opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
grave</i> be thrown into the rooms, and, if possible, upon
the beds of the inmates of the house they intend to
plunder, a death-like sleep will ensue, from which no
noise, however great, can awaken them, at least until
they have effected their nefarious purpose; but, curiously
enough, not only the robbers, but the robbed,
have firm faith in the efficacy of this application of
grave earth.</p>

<p>Having thus, as it were, propitiated the god of silence
and other supernatural authorities favorable to
burglary, I had the satisfaction of seeing them steal
stealthily from the doorway. At once I resolved, by
awakening my brother, to prove the impotency of the
charm, but the cunning hunchback, having either less
faith in the spell than his brethren, or questioning its
powers upon two lads of American birth, suddenly retraced
his steps, bringing with him one of his men.
Stationing this fellow upon the stone steps, he said:</p>

<p>“Crouch down here, To-ki, and keep thy cat-like
eyes upon yonder beds. I fear not the potency of
the earth, but should some demon, adverse to our
purpose, arouse them, thou hast a creese that can send
them into the soundest of slumbers.”</p>

<p>In reply to this cool command, which made my teeth
chatter, the amiable Chinese replied:</p>

<p>“Thy will shall be done, oh! mighty Huccuck; the
words of the ruler of demons are law to his slave;”
and down he crouched, fixing his mischievous, glaring,
oblique eyes, upon my brother’s bed. But his back was
towards me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>How vexatious was this turn in affairs! To attempt
to pass the man unarmed as I was would be
sheer madness, yet without so doing I could neither
awaken my brother nor alarm the household; still, it
was consoling that I had learned the hunchback’s
name—the knowledge might be of service in the future.</p>

<p>For some time I stood, pondering what course to
take, and upon the probable consequences of the burglary,
and I must admit that I was unkind enough to
care but very little about any loss Ebberfeld might
sustain.</p>

<p>But Marie! the rogues might slay her, or worse—for
such had happened before—kidnap, and sell her
into slavery in one of the other islands. The fear of
so terrible a fate determined me to awaken Martin at
all risks. But how? Well, I remembered that I had
a pistol bullet in my pocket. True, if it alighted upon
his face, it might give him an unpleasant blow, but
what was that in comparison with Marie’s safety?
And so the leaden messenger hit its mark, and at the
same moment I threw myself upon Mr. To-ki, who,
in his wondrous surprise, called upon his god Fo to
save him from the demon who had seized and robbed
him of his creese. To secure the latter had, of course,
been my main object. Aroused by the bullet, my
brother gave a sharp cry, and began to rub his eyes.</p>

<p>“Get up, Martin, get up,” I cried, “there are robbers
in the house; bring a sheet or a curtain to secure
this fellow!”</p>

<p>“All right,” he replied, now fully awakened; and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
another minute we had twisted, rope-like, a mosquito
curtain, and bound the arms and legs, indeed the whole
body, of our friend To-ki, as if we had been preparing
him for a mummy. Then, having secured him to the
bedstead, my brother hastily put on his clothes, and we
ran into the garden. There was a small ax lying upon
a seat; catching this up, Martin said:</p>

<p>“Clutch your creese tight, and we’ll make our way
into the Prince’s apartments, for it is there we shall
find Marie.”</p>

<p>By this time, notwithstanding the grave earth, the
servants were aroused. Seeing one, our cousin’s maid,
scampering towards us, we asked where her young mistress
was confined.</p>

<p>“Alas! alas! the hour I was born,” she cried; “they
have taken her away.”</p>

<p>“Taken her away!” exclaimed Martin, seizing the
girl by the wrist. “Say, <i>who</i> has taken her away?”</p>

<p>“The robber, the hunchback, the snake-charmer.”</p>

<p>“This is Ebberfeld’s doing!” he cried, wildly; “let
us to his room, Claud.”</p>

<p>But imagine our surprise upon reaching that
worthy’s chamber, which immediately adjoined our
aunt’s, to find him in a position similar to that in which
we had just left Mr. To-ki, bound hand and foot, and
secured to one of the legs of a massive ebony bedstead.
There was this difference only, and that excited a certain
suspicion in my mind, the cords were so comparatively
loose that a man of his strength might, at least
so I thought, have easily released himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“My boys, my boys,” he whined, “thank God <i>you</i>
are safe. Uncut these cords; it may yet be time to secure
the thieves. But your aunt, your cousin, are they
safe?”</p>

<p>“Do you not know that our cousin Marie has been
carried away?” said my brother, as he cut the cords.</p>

<p>“Boy,” he replied, now with his old savageness of
manner, “I know nothing, except that I was suddenly
awakened by three men, who placed me in the position
from which you have just released me. But,” he
added, “lose no time; arouse the slaves and servants,
and we may yet be able to prevent the rogues from
quitting the town.”</p>

<p>We required no second command, and in a few minutes
members of the Ebberfeld household were scampering
in every direction. But it was fruitless, for, although
the city police were aroused and made every
search, no clue could be obtained of the depredators,
nor, alas! of Marie; and to add to the mystery, even
the Chinese whom we had so tightly bound, and from
whom we might have obtained some information,
managed to escape. In a sentence, it was a clever robbery—so
clever, that it marked an epoch in the minds
of the Dutch colonists of Batavia.</p>

<p>The authorities, however, did not let the matter rest
there, for so great was the consternation of the inhabitants
of the upper town, at the abduction of so
considerable a personage as the heiress of their late
respected councilor Van Black, that early the next
morning they sent a party of police to explore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
neighboring mountains, as the most likely place for
the robbers to have taken refuge. With this party
went Mynheer Ebberfeld, clamorously declaring that
if it cost him his fortune and life he would rescue his
stolen ward. Both Martin and I begged permission
to accompany him, but the affectionate man replied
that he and his wife had already suffered so great a
loss that they would not risk a still greater; “for who
knows,” he said, “whether we may not have to encounter
an armed band?”</p>

<p>“Well, and suppose we do; don’t you think we can
fight for Marie?” said Martin. But he was only
snubbed for his forwardness.</p>

<p>Five anxious days and sleepless nights were we kept
in suspense as to the fate of our cousin, and, to do
our aunt justice, she at least <i>seemed</i> to share our grief.
Imagine, therefore, our sensations when, on the morning
of the sixth, we heard Ebberfeld’s berlin rattling
across the courtyard. In an instant we ran to my
lady’s sitting-room, knowing that he would at once go
there. Mynheer was standing, sadly, gloomily, with
his hand resting upon the back of the sofa, upon
which his wife was sitting, and looking as dismal as
himself, for he had hastily imparted to her the gist
of his news.</p>

<p>“Our cousin, have you news of her, Mynheer?” we
asked.</p>

<p>“Alas! yes.”</p>

<p>“Why alas? Is it bad? What is it?” exclaimed
Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“My dear lads,” he said, in his most oily tone, and
with the mock sorrow of a hired mute upon his countenance,
“you will never see poor Marie again; she is
in heaven.”</p>

<p>We stood as if dumb with amazement.</p>

<p>“The villains,” he continued, “it is supposed, finding
themselves pursued, and fearing that the incumbrance
of their prisoner would insure their capture, slew the
poor, dear girl, and threw her body into the nearest
stream.”</p>

<p>“It is false! I don’t believe it!” cried Martin;
whereupon I expected Mynheer would have fallen into
a passion, and told us no more; but, not noticing the
offensive words, he added, “That, although there was
some little difficulty at first in recognizing the features,
as when found life must have been extinct two days”—a
long period in such a climate—“from the clothes,
a locket, ring, watch, and the purse found upon her,
there was not the least doubt as to her identity.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” observed Martin, thoughtfully, skeptically,
“that robbers should not have taken such valuables.”</p>

<p>“<i>Most</i> wonderful!” replied Mynheer, quickly; “but
it is supposed that, in their haste and fear of being
captured, they overlooked the trinkets. But it matters
not,” he added, in a whining tone; “would that they
<i>had</i> taken them, aye, and all I possess, had they but
saved the poor dear child’s life. It is sad, most sad!”</p>

<p>“For <i>us</i>,” said my brother, fiercely, “it is sad—worse
than our own deaths; but for you, Mynheer—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“It is a calamity that has cut me to the heart,” interposed
our guardian.</p>

<p>“It may be so, or it may not,” said my brother,
adding defiantly, but deliberately, and with a searching
glance into the notary’s face, as if to watch the effect
the words would produce, “but, Mynheer, you will
find a consolation in her fortune. Now you will be
able to give the Prince more money.”</p>

<p>In an instant I placed myself between them, for I
thought Mynheer would then and there have felled
him to the ground. He turned deathly pale, his features
were contorted into a demoniacal expression, his
right hand was clenched and uplifted.</p>

<p>“Forgive him, Mynheer,” exclaimed our aunt, probably
with the same fear, for she rose from her seat.
“The poor boy is bereft of his senses, and he knows
not what he is saying.”</p>

<p>Mynheer spoke not a word, but was evidently endeavoring
to suppress the rage which, by the way,
was plainly enough stamped upon his countenance.
But Martin, fearless of consequences, replied:</p>

<p>“I am <i>not</i> mad. Madam, my aunt, I <i>don’t</i> want him
to forgive me, any more than I will ever forgive him;
and now I have said it, you may kill me, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“Boy,” said Mynheer, when he had sufficiently mastered
his rage to permit of his speaking without committing
himself, “what mean you? what words are
these? who put them into your mouth?”</p>

<p>“The <i>dead</i>,” replied Martin—“poor Marie; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
am sorry that she did, or that she <i>knew</i> it herself; for,
had she not made the discovery, or had you not been
aware of her knowledge, it is my belief she would have
been here now.”</p>

<p>Then, most wonderful for a man whose wont it was
to give way to the most violent anger, even upon
trivial occasions, Mynheer only smiled, saying, in a
kindly, pitying tone:</p>

<p>“Martin, my dear boy, your grief for your cousin
has indeed made you mad, and I forgive you in spite
of yourself. But get you at once to your room; there
you may give full vent to your natural feelings without
offense; to-morrow, perhaps, you will regret what you
have said.”</p>

<p>Martin was about to reply, but, taking him by the
arm, I said, “Brother, brother, no more angry words
at such a time as this;” and he permitted me to lead
him from the presence of our amiable guardians.</p>

<p>“Martin,” I said, when we were in our own room,
“it was unwise, it was foolish, to beard the lion when
we have to live in his very den.”</p>

<p>“It was <i>not</i> foolish, Claud; it was <i>right</i>. It was on
my mind, and now it is off; and but for you, I would
have told him that he was the cause of our cousin’s
death. I tell you, brother, I am certain he killed her.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, Martin, at all events you have made
an enemy for life—a dangerous one; for now he
<i>knows</i> that you are cognizant of too much for his
safety, or at least comfort.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, old fellow, it does not matter,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
replied, quite coolly; “I don’t think it is likely I shall
see him again, for I have made up my mind to quit this
house to-night.”</p>

<p>“Martin,” said I, astonished at his words, “this is
nonsense. Why, even <i>I</i> shall soon believe you ‘a little
mad.’”</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Claud. I <i>should</i> be mad indeed to
stop here to be poisoned, or spirited away without an
instant’s warning, and for the sake of a little money
too, for that is what it will come to. No, no, brother;
I have resolved to go away this very night, and you
will accompany me, if you are not so mad as you
would make me out.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, Martin, we will talk about it to-night,
and make up our minds in the morning,” I replied;
and when I said those words, I believed I should be
able to dissuade my brother from what then appeared
to me to be, at the least, a very wild project; but so
eloquently and earnestly did he place before me the
danger to be apprehended if we remained any longer
under the same roof with Ebberfeld, that I not only
permitted him to persuade me to join him in his flight,
but became, if possible, more desirous than himself.
But where were we to fly to? Martin suggested that
we should go at once to the lower town, and, making
a confidant of a certain merchant named Vandervelden,
who had once been a clerk to our uncle, beg of him to
send us to sea in one of his ships; and, as I could
suggest no better scheme, we arranged to start the
following morning about an hour before daybreak, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the household would be stirring, and when we
knew that the road between the upper and lower towns
would be clear. And now I have fully explained to
you the events of those two years which led to our
adventures in the wilds of the island.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

<small>WE RUN AWAY AND TAKE SERVICE WITH “NEST-HUNTERS.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> of a more nervous temperament than my
brother, I could not, like him, sleep at will, and that,
too, upon the very eve of so important an enterprise.
No! I lay awake, pondering upon the dark future, and
weighing in my mind the probable consequences of a
failure; then, again, there was Martin snoring loudly
enough to prevent a whole house-full of people from
sleeping. At length, however, Somnus must have
taken me in his arms, for I dreamt that we had started
upon our journey, but that, soon after we had left the
house, Ebberfeld came suddenly behind us, and, taking
hold of my ears, began to drag me back again; and the
pain awaking me, I heard the voice of Martin.</p>

<p>“Claud—Claud!” he whispered in one ear, while he
tugged at the other, “it is near daybreak; get up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I should think not; it is very dark,”
said I, really neither asleep nor awake; but another
good tug, and “Come, get up, old fellow, or we sha’n’t
be off before Ebberfeld is stirring.”</p>

<p>That name had a talismanic effect; it reminded me
of the necessity for immediate action, so I jumped out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
of bed, dressed, and in a few minutes, with our boots
in our hands, for fear of disturbing the inmates, we
were softly stepping through the house; but, reaching
the courtyard, we found the gates locked.</p>

<p>“This is a serious difficulty,” said I.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Martin; “let us clamber over
the wall.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, there were some tall trees within a few
yards; one of these we ascended to the requisite height,
and by a slight jump attained the top; then, dropping
down upon the other side, we found ourselves in the
open streets, alone—yes! alone in the world, prepared
to encounter its sternest difficulties; and that, too, but
with a small stock in trade to commence with—namely,
ten dollars (“It is a shame we haven’t more with us,
seeing that we have a fortune of our own, if we could
only get at it,” said Martin), the clothes we stood upright
in, a pair of rifled pistols, which had been presented
to us by “my lady” some time before, and—though
last, not least in utility—the Malay creese I had
taken from the Chinese thief. Our prospects did not
seem very bright, to be sure, but then it must be remembered,
whether rightly or not, we felt convinced
that we were flying for our lives; that feeling, and the
full belief that two youths, numbering between them
thirty-three years, strong, healthy, and determined,
could not very well starve, whether in cities or forests,
gave us such confidence that we set forth in excellent
spirits.</p>

<p>For the first mile of our descent, we met not a living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
soul; indeed, had there been any person on the road,
it was so dark that we could not have seen him. As
day began to break, we met a native porter, who was
making his way from the lower to the upper town, beneath
a load that would have crushed an ordinary
American horse. These fellows, by the way, are a
marvel to all new-comers in the island, for it is not
unusual to see them, thus heavily laden, travel thirty
miles a day for several days successively; true, their
pace is not more than three miles an hour, at the
quickest; but then, if slow, they are sure. Well, from
this man we heard good news—namely, that that day
was a kind of festival or holiday among the natives of
the lower town; good, because, from the great number
of people that would be in the streets, we should
the better escape the attention of any kind friend who
might (and of course we believed that anybody would
know, as well as ourselves, that we were runaways)
feel it his duty to send Mynheer information as to our
whereabouts.</p>

<p>The next incident we met with was curious enough.
We had several times fancied we heard footsteps, as if
of some person running behind us; just after, however,
we had passed the porter, the sky grew whiter, and,
turning round, we saw a native running after us.</p>

<p>“Mynheer has discovered our absence; that is one of
his slaves,” said I. “Let us run for it;” and away we
ran down the hill, till, fairly out of breath, we stopped
to rest.</p>

<p>“Slave or no slave, I sha’n’t run any more, for, after
all, we are two to one,” said Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>A minute afterwards the person passed us, and slackened
his pace as he came near an old man, who seemed
to be toiling his way up the hill, almost overcome by
some load which he carried in a basket. Then, when
the two met, without stopping an instant, the younger
caught the basket out of the old fellow’s hands, and
ran off with it. Seeing the latter sink down upon the
roadside, Martin cried out, “Let us after that thief—he
has taken advantage of the old man’s weakness and
fatigue to overcome him;” and we began to pursue the
robber; but as we passed the victim, as we supposed,
he cried—</p>

<p>“Stay, Sahib, that man is no thief; he is pursuing a
holy duty. If you stop him, the gods will shower their
vengeance upon him and all of us.”</p>

<p>“This is queer,” said Martin, in surprise, and he
asked the old man for an explanation. All, however,
that we could make out was that the basket contained
the skull of a buffalo, which, for some reason known
only to themselves, the native priests had ordered to
be conducted from one part of the island to another,
insisting that it should never be permitted to rest,
neither by night nor by day; thus, it had been kept
in constant progressive motion, one person taking it
from another, until it had been carried several hundred
miles, each carrier being given to understand, that he
who should let it rest but for an instant would call
down upon his head the most dreadful vengeance of
the gods.</p>

<p>Quitting the old gentleman, we proceeded on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
way, heartily laughing at the superstitious feelings that
had induced so many persons to give themselves so
much trouble about nothing. The old man’s story of
the skull, however, reminded me of another I had
heard, illustrative of the credulity of the poor natives
of Java.</p>

<p>Some years before, it was unexpectedly discovered
that in a remote but populous part of the island of
Java a road was constructed, leading to the top of
the mountain Sumbeng, one of the highest in the
island. An inquiry being set on foot, it was discovered
that the delusion which gave rise to the work had its
origin in the province of Banyumas, in the territories
of the Susunan; that the infection spread to the territory
of the Sultan, from whence it extended to that of
the European Power. On examination, a road was
found constructed, seventy feet broad, and from fifty
to sixty miles in extent, wonderfully smooth and well
made. One point which appears to have been considered
necessary was, that the road should not cross
rivers, the consequence of which was that it winded in
a thousand ways, that the principle might not be infringed.
Another point as peremptorily insisted upon
was, that the straight course of the road should not be
interrupted by any regard to private rights; and, in
consequence, trees and houses were overturned to make
way for it.</p>

<p>The population of whole districts, occasionally to
the amount of five and six thousand laborers, were
employed on the road; and among a people disinclined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to active exertion, the laborious work was nearly completed
in two months—such was the effect of the temporary
enthusiasm with which they were inspired. It
appeared in the sequel, that a bare report had set the
whole work in motion. An old woman had dreamt,
or pretended to have dreamt, that a divine personage
was about to descend from heaven on the mountain
Sumbeng. Piety suggested the propriety of constructing
a road to facilitate his descent; and divine vengeance,
it was rumored, would pursue the sacrilegious
person who refused to join in the meritorious labor.</p>

<p>These reports quickly wrought on the fears and ignorance
of the people, and they heartily joined in the
enterprise. The old woman distributed slips of palm-leaves
to the laborers, with magic letters written upon
them, as charms against wounds and sickness. When
this strange affair was discovered by the native authorities,
orders were given to desist from the work, and
the inhabitants returned, without murmur, to their
wonted occupations.</p>

<p>In no spot on the globe, perhaps, is there to be
met such a various collection of the human race as in
that lower town of Batavia, at which we arrived
shortly after our adventure with the old gentleman of
the buffalo skull—Hindoos, who, with the setting in
of the westerly monsoons, come in shoals to seek their
fortunes in a country richer by nature than the peninsula;
shrewd, supple, unwarlike, mendacious, and
avaricious Chinese—keen-witted, laborious, luxurious,
yet sensual and pusillanimous, but whose intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and activity have placed in their hands the management
of the public revenue in almost every country of
the Archipelago—the end and object of their lives,
after the accumulation of wealth, being to return to
the Celestial Empire, to lay their bones in the tombs
of their ancestors; natives of the other islands, Malays,
Dutch, Spaniards, half-castes, and lastly Arabs—ambitious,
intriguing, and bigoted, but who possess a
strength of character which places them far above the
simple natives of the Indian islands, to whom, in matters
of religion, they dictate with that arrogance with
which the meanest of the countrymen of Mahomed
consider they are entitled to conduct themselves; but
withal, Arabs, when not devoted to spiritual concerns,
and occupied in mercantile affairs, have the reputation
of being fair and adventurous merchants.</p>

<p>Now, upon ordinary days, during business hours,
there is ever much bustle and traffic in the lower town.
Upon that day, however, the streets were crowded as
you only see streets crowded in Asiatic cities, but then
it was with merry-makers, idlers, pleasure-seekers; for,
as I have said, it was a holiday among the Asiatics—business
seemed suspended; Europeans, except those
who had come as spectators, were scarce. So far this
suited our purpose, for we should have less chance of
meeting any friends of Ebberfeld; but, upon the other
hand, it was a great chance if we should find our
friend, the merchant, in town, and if not, we should
have to seek a lodging in some native hut. Still, we
resolved to go to his warehouse, which was situated on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the bank of the canal, which runs between the town
and the sea.</p>

<p>Making our way through the crowds of people, we
could not but be amused. The men and women
seemed to be divided into groups—some, chiefly old
men, flying kites shaped like wild animals, the game
being to pit them against each other, the conqueror
being he who could bring down his adversary’s kite;
some gazing at itinerant jugglers, snake-charmers,
dancing-girls, or actors; another deeply interested in
a cock-fight—a less cruel game with the Javanese than
that which used to disgrace America in our grandsires’
days, for the birds have but their natural spurs; another
group would be gazing at a fight between two
quails; another deeply interested in a combat between
two crickets, the little animals being excited to battle
by the titillation of a blade of grass applied to their
noses; then others, and those groups were numerous,
sitting down gambling with dice.</p>

<p>So extravagant is the passion for gaming among the
Javanese, that it pervades all orders, from the prince
to the peasant. The common laborers no sooner receive
their hard-earned money, than they form a ring
in the public street or highway, sit down deliberately,
and squander it all away. On a market-day, in every
part of the country where open gaming is not absolutely
prohibited, men and women, old and young,
form themselves into groups in the streets of the
market for the purposes of play, and the attention of
the stranger is soon attracted to these crowds by the
tumultuary and anxious vociferation of the players.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>But there can be no more striking illustration than
the artifice resorted to by the proprietors of treasure,
or other valuable property, to protect it at night from
the depredation of thieves, when it is transported from
one part of the country to another. The only antidote
to the supine carelessness and somnolency of the
Javanese is play, and the proprietor of the property,
therefore, furnishes the party with a sum to gamble
for, which insures a degree of vigilance which no inducement
of fear, duty, or reward could command.</p>

<p>Among the Malays and people of Celebes, the influence
of play is still more violent. After losing their
money, they stake their jewels, their side-arms, their
slaves, and, it is often alleged, even their wives and
children, or, in the last extremity, their own personal
freedom. With these tribes, the disputes which arise
at the gaming-table are often terminated by the dagger,
or generate incurable feuds between families.</p>

<p>We had found our way through the crowd, and had
reached the comparatively deserted bank of the canal,
when our attention was called to a noisy group of some
fourteen or fifteen persons squatting in a ring. Approaching
nearer, we could see these by-sitters were
watching two men, who sat in the middle throwing
dice. One of the gamblers—and who, from the satisfactory
smile upon his countenance, seemed to be the
winner—was a Chinese; the other a powerful-chested,
strong-limbed man, whose deep-brown skin, round
face, square chin, and long, lank, harsh, dark hair,
bespoke him a native of Bali. I watched him narrowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
for some few minutes, and from his vociferation at
every reverse fall of the dice, and his exclamations in
bad Dutch and Javanese, I judged him to be a sailor,
belonging to one of the merchant ships in the harbor.
Well, from what I could gather from the other spectators,
the sailor had been winning before we had come
up, notwithstanding the smiling face of the Chinese;
but be that as it may, it was certain that he was losing
now, for as the dice fell, no matter by whom thrown,
the Celestial swept away the money staked. But the
sympathies of the lookers-on seemed to be with him,
for at every loss they goaded him to try his fortune
again, till at length he had no money left, and, with a
wild yell, he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Thy creese, Kati! stake thy creese—it will turn
thy luck,” cried a Javanese; and for a moment the
sailor stood as if in a state of indecision, for the
weapon is sacred in the eye of an Indian islander.
Then, however, kissing its hilt, as if taking an affectionate
leave of the weapon, he threw it upon the
ground. The Chinese placed a little pile of silver
against it, and again the dice were thrown, and again
with ill-luck; and now the reckless wretch had lost his
all, and so furious was the expression of his eyes, that
I instinctively moved aside, expecting to see him
snatch up the weapon and run a “muck” among us.
But no, remembering that he had not lost quite all, he
said, “Dog of a Chinese! I am a free man; I have
still my liberty; and that I will stake against my beautiful
creese;” by which he meant that, should he lose the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
next throw, he would become the slave of the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Celestial coolly bowed his assent to the proposal;
but before either could again take up the dice,
a man, forcing his way through the by-squatters, and
seizing the sailor by the arm, said, sternly,—</p>

<p>“Kati, hast already forgotten the service I did thee,
thou art so ready to play thyself into slavery to this
dog of a Chinese? Are the men of Bali so ungrateful
that they so easily forget their benefactors?”</p>

<p>At the touch upon his arm, Kati turned fiercely
round, but, seeing and hearing who it was, he fell at
his feet, exclaiming: “Pardon, oh! my master; an evil
demon possessed thy servant, and he forgot that he
was about to play away that which, like his life, was
his master’s.”</p>

<p>The new-comer then, throwing to the Chinese the
amount of silver for which Kati had staked and lost
his creese, took up the weapon, and, giving it to the
sailor, said—</p>

<p>“Now, get thee at once to the prahu, and as you
value your life, and, more, my friendship, leave it not
till I come on board; for, lion as thou art at sea and
in the caves, among thieves and gamesters thou art
but a silly mouse.”</p>

<p>In an instant the sailor proceeded towards the harbor,
and his master turned towards us. We had recognized
the voice: it was Prabu.</p>

<p>“Allah is great! My young masters here, and by
themselves!” he exclaimed, with surprise; but then, as
if a sudden thought had occurred to him, he asked, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
a whisper: “Does ‘my lady’ and Mynheer know of
your being here?”</p>

<p>“No, Prabu,” said Martin; and he was about to tell
him a portion of our story, but the latter, interrupting
him, said:</p>

<p>“Then if my young masters do not desire their
whereabouts to reach their ears, let them follow, but at
a distance, as if they knew me not;” and, without another
word, he proceeded along the bank of the canal,
but in an opposite direction to that taken by Kati.</p>

<p>“<i>Shall</i> we follow him, Martin?” said I, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course. Why not? It is a good omen, don’t
you see, that chance, the Providence of fools, is about
to befriend us. Perhaps he is going nest-hunting, and
will take us with him.”</p>

<p>“But can we trust him? Will he not take us back
to Mynheer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can trust him; and I am sure he <i>won’t</i>
take us back to Mynheer; for although he is, in some
way or other, mysteriously mixed up with that bad
man, Prabu is an honest fellow, or I am no judge;”
and as, when my brother spoke in that off-hand manner
and came to a decision with abruptness, I knew it was
useless to attempt to argue with him, I followed the
ex-slave without further comment, only wondering
what it was the “fool’s Providence,” as Martin had
termed chance, had in store for us.</p>

<p>Having walked about half a mile along the bank,
Prabu came to a dead halt in front of a spacious but
very low bamboo building, which I at first believed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
be some warehouse. When, however, we got up to
him, he said:</p>

<p>“My young masters do not desire that Mynheer
should know that they have been with Prabu. Thus
it was that he thought it well not to be seen with
them. Let them now follow him into the house, for
there they can unbosom themselves without fear.”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, shrinking backwards, as I caught a
view of the interior, “I do not like to enter this vile
place; it is an opium-house.”</p>

<p>“It is not the house that is bad, but the people who
frequent it, and with them my master need have no
association. Let them enter fearlessly, for it is here
only we can converse without fear of seeing any of the
Dutch merchants.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother! Don’t be so particular, Claud. Come
along; Prabu knows best. We are not to be bad, because
others are, surely,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh! very well,” said I, seeing Martin was getting
angry, “lead on; but, mind, I shall not smoke the
horrid stuff.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t suppose anybody will ask you,” replied
my brother; and in we went. As, however, I
walked up the room, I felt as much contaminated as if I
had been in a New York rum-shop. But the scene was
even worse. Along each side of the room were separate
divisions or chambers, with matted floors, upon
which sat or reclined Chinese, in one of the phases consequent
upon the free use of opium—one giddily
stupid; another in loquacious intoxication; another in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
something like convulsions; another as if in a state of
beatification; but all with emaciated forms, wild,
staring eyes, a slight cough, and hectic cheeks: but not
one, certainly, who seemed likely, or, indeed, capable,
of listening with profit to anything we might have to
say.</p>

<p>Having led us to one of the largest of these chambers,
Prabu bade us seat ourselves upon the matting;
then, following our example, he called to an attendant,
who brought him a small pipe filled with a mixture of
tobacco and opium. To do Prabu justice, however, he
was no debauched opium-smoker, but called for the
drug on this occasion, that the attendant might readily
believe him to be an ordinary visitor, and not a spy
upon the actions and words of others—a character, by
the way, not uncommon in these dens, where it is believed
by the authorities that conspiracies are ever
being hatched for the overthrow of European rule.</p>

<p>While, however, he is taking his whiff, I must say a
few words about this most deleterious narcotic, which,
by the way, has made so much noise, and done so much
mischief, in the world. First, let me premise that the
Indian islanders invariably <i>smoke</i> instead of chew
opium, like the inhabitants of continental Asia. The
method of preparing it for use is as follows: The raw
opium is first boiled or seethed in a copper vessel; then
strained through a cloth, to free it from impurities;
and then a second time boiled. The leaf of the <i>tambaku</i>,
shredded fine, is mixed with it, in a quantity sufficient
to absorb the whole; and it is afterwards made up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
into pills, about the size of peas, for smoking. One
of these being put into the small tube that projects
from the side of the opium-pipe, that tube is applied
to a lamp, and the pill, being lighted, is consumed at
one whiff or inflation of the lungs, attended with a
whistling noise. The smoke is never emitted by the
mouth, but usually receives vent through the nostrils,
and sometimes, by adepts, through the passage of the
ears and eyes. This preparation of the opium is called
<i>maadat</i>, and is often adulterated in the process by mixing
<i>jaggri</i>, or pine sugar, with it, as is the raw opium
by incorporating with it the fruit of the <i>pisang</i>, or
plantain.</p>

<p>Having held the pipe sufficiently long to prevent
suspicion, Prabu laid it aside, saying:</p>

<p>“My young masters may now, without fear of being
overheard, say for what reason they have run away
from the house of Mynheer, and ‘my lady,’ his wife.”</p>

<p>Martin replied by relating the whole of our story,
not reserving a single item—no, not even his opinion
that Ebberfeld was the real cause of our cousin’s death.
To which Prabu, having listened attentively, said:</p>

<p>“Allah is great! and if He has put it into the hearts
of my young masters to run from their home, like
frightened deer from the hunters, it is not for Prabu
to send them back to Mynheer; for, <i>if the words they
utter about him be good</i>, he must be a bad man, and it
would be to send them into danger; for although we
know that the poison of a centipede is in its head, the
poison of a scorpion in its tail, the poison of the snake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
in its tooth, the venom of a bad man is fixed to no one
spot, but dispersed over his whole body, and so is more
to be feared than either. But my young masters must
eat and drink and sleep; and <i>how</i> can they do these
without a home?”</p>

<p>“We would seek Mynheer Vandervelden, and in the
name of our uncle, who was good to him, beg that he
will employ us in one of his ships, or even in his counting-house,”
said I.</p>

<p>“To go to sea in one of his ships would be good, to
remain in the counting-house bad, for you would still
be in danger,” said Prabu.</p>

<p>“No, <i>I</i> do not <i>now</i> wish to go to Mynheer Vandervelden
at all,” said Martin; adding—“I have been told
that our uncle was good also to you, Prabu?”</p>

<p>“He was more: he was my friend and benefactor,
and to him or <i>his</i>, Prabu hopes some day to repay the
benefits which then, as now, lay heavily upon his head.
But Prabu is but a poor hunter—a gatherer of birds’-nests;
and what can he do to benefit the nephew of his
benefactor? Alas! nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, much!” replied Martin. “You are a nest-hunter.
I heard you speak of a prahu to the man
Katu. Take us with you; teach us to be nest-hunters
also; and so we may get our bread until we are of
sufficient age to come forward and claim our own
money.”</p>

<p>“It is a wild scheme, Martin,” said I. Then to the
ex-slave I added: “No, I fear that boys like us would
but encumber your vessel. Therefore, good Prabu, go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
with us to Mynheer Vandervelden, and beg of him to
take us into his service; for he will listen to you, who
are so much older than us, and, like him, had received
benefits from our good uncle.”</p>

<p>“Claud, I will <i>not</i> go to Vandervelden; I am determined!
Are you so cowardly that you fear to go
with Prabu?”</p>

<p>“My young masters, my sons,” said Prabu, dreading
that a quarrel was imminent between us, “in Allah’s
name, dispute not! Be of one mind, or, like the tiger
and the forest, you will both come to grief.”</p>

<p>“Bother! What have the tiger and the forest got
to do with us?” interrupted my brother, now good-humoredly,
and, I could see, regretting his hasty
words.</p>

<p>“Much,” replied Prabu, sententiously; adding: “A
tiger and a forest had united in close friendship, and
they afforded each other mutual protection. When
men wanted to take wood or leaves from the forest,
they were dissuaded by their fear of the tiger; and
when they would take the tiger, he was concealed by
the forest. After a long time, the forest was rendered
foul by the residence of the tiger, and it began to be
estranged from him. The tiger thereupon quitted the
forest, and men, having found out that it was no
longer guarded, came in numbers and cut down the
wood and robbed the leaves, so that in a short time the
forest was destroyed, and became a bare place. The
tiger, leaving the forest, was seen, and although he
attempted to hide himself in clefts and valleys, men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
attacked and killed him; and thus, by their disagreement,
the forest was exterminated, and the tiger lost
his life.”</p>

<p>“Prabu is right, brother; we must stick together if
we would be successful,” said Martin, when our new
friend had concluded his fable. “But look you, Claud,”
he added, in his usual impetuous, warm-hearted manner,
“you don’t mean to say that you thought I meant
what I said, did you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, Martin—at least, I know you don’t
now,” I replied, shaking his offered hand; “and to
show you that we are of one mind, I am ready to go on
board the prahu at once, if Prabu is willing to take us.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! You are a good-natured old boy, Claud,
and I <i>am</i> ashamed of myself. But, Prabu,” he said to
our companion, “<i>will</i> you take us nest-gathering?”</p>

<p>“My young masters have been delicately reared; is
it possible, then, that they can bear the hardships of a
nest-gatherer’s life?” he replied, evasively.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” replied Martin, laughing; “you don’t
take us Yankee boys for a couple of sugar-candy figures,
or wax dolls, do you? Come, don’t keep us in
suspense, but say, like a good fellow, whether you will
or will not take us with you.”</p>

<p>“My young master is as brave as a lion: it shall be
as he desires; Prabu cannot refuse.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” replied my brother, rejoicingly. “I knew
I should <i>some</i> day go nest-hunting.”</p>

<p>“When the sun has disappeared from the heavens,
and the earth is shrouded in the darkness of night, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
young masters shall go on board the prahu; but they
have been many hours without food, and must be
hungered; let them follow me.”</p>

<p>And so saying, Prabu arose and led us into another
room; and having, after the Indian fashion, seated ourselves
upon the floor, an attendant brought us a meal
which was more remarkable for quantity than, at least
in our opinion, savoriness. It consisted of balls of
rice, and a dish of a preparation called <i>blachang</i>. It
was the first time we had partaken of this dish, which,
by the way, is the universal sauce of the Indian islands,
no food being deemed palatable without it; and that it
must have some peculiar merit is certain, for although,
in common with other Americans, we at first were disgusted
with it, like them, in turn, we ultimately became
as partial to it as the natives. But whether my readers
would like it, they may judge from the following
graphic description given of it by the old sea-captain
Dampier:</p>

<p>“<i>Balachaun</i> is a composition of a strong savor, yet
a very delightsome dish to the natives of this country.
To make it, they throw the mixture of shrimps and
small fish into a sort of weak pickle, made with salt and
water, and put it into a tight earthen vessel or jar.
The pickle being thus weak, it keeps not the fish firm
and hard, neither is it probably so designed, for the
fish are never gutted. Therefore, in a short time, they
turn all to a mash in the vessel; and when they have
lain thus a good while, so that the fish is reduced to a
pap, they then draw off the liquor into fresh jars, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
preserve it for use. The mashed fish that remains behind
is called <i>balachaun</i>, and the liquor poured off is
called <i>nuke-mum</i>. The poor people eat the <i>balachaun</i>
with their rice. ’Tis rank-scented, yet the taste is not
altogether unpleasant, but rather savory, after one is
a little used to it. The <i>nuke-mum</i> is of a pale-brown
color, inclining to gray, and pretty clear. It is also
very savory, and used as a good sauce for fowls, not
only by the natives, but also by many Europeans, who
esteem it equal with soy.”</p>

<p>But to return to my narrative. When the sun had
sunk beneath the horizon, and the mantle of night had
spread o’er land and sea, Prabu bade us arise and follow
him.</p>

<p>“But,” said I, “in this darkness”—for it was so dark
that we could but indistinctly see each other—“we shall
fall into the canal.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, old fellow,” said Martin; “I will catch
hold of Prabu’s <i>sarong</i>, and you fasten on to my
jacket;” and in this manner we proceeded towards the
quay. Having arrived there, we could see, at the
furthermost end, the glittering light of a lantern.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Prabu; “Kati is awaiting our coming.”</p>

<p>When we reached the very verge, we could just perceive
the dim outlines of a vessel moored alongside,
leaving a gap of sea between it and the shore, too
wide for us to step on board; but Kati was on the
qui vive, and the echo of a call in Javanese from our
guide had not died away before the light approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the side of the vessel, and two planks were thrown
across, by which we reached the deck, and were at once
conducted by Prabu to a small cabin, strewn with thick
soft mats, upon which he bade us stretch ourselves,
saying, “My young masters are now in safety, but they
are fatigued; let them rest.”</p>

<p>“But when are we to sail?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“With the first wind,” he replied, leaving us.</p>

<p>“Prabu’s glum: I hope he is not going to play the
tyrant, now he has us cooped up in this nutshell,”
said Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope not,” said I; “but sneaking on board
in the darkness of night is rather an ominous entrance
upon a new career.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother! Now you are at your witch business
again, Claud, so I sha’n’t say another word;” and
stretching himself at full length upon the matting, with
a bamboo pillow for his head, he very soon went off to
sleep—an example I speedily followed.</p>

<p>I have often heard people declare they could not
sleep in strange beds or places for the first few nights.
Only let them have to fly away from their homes, under
the belief that it is to save their lives, have a long
day’s fatigue and anxiety, and at length find themselves
in a place of security, and they will tell a different
story. As for my brother and I, as the sailors say, we
ran right round the reel, not once waking till the middle
of the next day, when the sun was at its hottest—so
hot in those latitudes, that you could broil a shad
on the decks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Hilloa! Claud, this don’t look like tyranny, at all
events: that Prabu <i>must</i> be a good fellow, after all,”
said Martin, as, opening his eyes, he saw a dish of
delicious-looking fruits placed at the other end of the
cabin, ready for our first meal. Then we arose, but ere
we had dressed, a Hindu boy came to us, bringing
cups, boiling water, and tea, which we mixed after the
Chinese fashion—namely, placing a couple of pinches
in the cup, and then pouring the boiling water thereon.</p>

<p>Well, we had partaken of our first cup, and were
preparing the second; Martin was pouring the boiling
water into the cup, when suddenly it danced out of
the saucer, upsetting its contents over his hand.</p>

<p>“Hang it! what’s that?” he exclaimed, shaking his
hand with pain.</p>

<p>I jumped up, frightened; was as quickly capsized;
but the cause at once flitting through my mind, I,
laughing, said, “that it was the lurching of the vessel,
and we haven’t got our sea-legs yet.”</p>

<p>“Why, do you mean to say that we have sailed—that
we are out at sea already?” and Martin ran out
upon deck.</p>

<p>I followed him. Prabu was standing upon the poop,
giving orders to his lieutenant, Kati; but, seeing us,
he said, pointing to the now somewhat distant shore:
“My young masters need not fear that their enemy
will catch them; they are safe.”</p>

<p>“But, Prabu,” said my brother, “this is not fair
sailing; when I asked you last night when we should
sail, you said with the first wind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“That was true; for without one, the prophet himself
could not sail a prahu.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know that; but why did you not tell
us how soon?”</p>

<p>“A wise man keepeth his left hand in ignorance of
the actions of his right: besides, what is written is
written; and it was written that my young master
should go with Prabu this voyage. It was well, therefore,
not to let them know the hour of departure, for
they are young, and their hearts might have grown
faint at the last moment; as it is, they are refreshed;
they have had a long, undisturbed sleep, which has
made men of them.”</p>

<p>“Then you thought I was a coward, who would
shrink from an adventure after I had taken the first
step?”</p>

<p>“Prabu thinks no evil of the young masters; he
knows they are not cowards, yet the bravest men have
faltered at their first beginnings.”</p>

<p>Our new captain then, walking away upon some
ship’s business, left us to make a survey of the craft
which carried the Blacks and their fortunes.</p>

<p>We had expected to find a small, dirty Malay prahu,
like the generality of those used by the maritime tribes
of the Archipelago; guess, then, our astonishment, to
find ourselves on board a large vessel of some thirty-five
tons burden, well-formed, with a great poop,
flanked on either side by a platform; a helm at each
end, a couple of masts, with sails of bamboo matting:
moreover, instead of the dirt and chaos of disorder to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
be found on board most native vessels, the decks were
almost as clean as those of an American man-of-war.
Then there seemed to be a place for everything, and
everything in its place. The crew, consisting of twenty
men, were for the greater part natives of the islands,
probably picked from the fishing tribes. That which,
however, struck me as most extraordinary in a native
trading-vessel was, that the fore-deck was armed with
a couple of six-pounders. Seeing the surprise with
which my brother and I regarded the latter, Prabu,
who had come up to us, said, “To men who know how
to use them, these fire-dogs are useful, in seas infested
by Chinese pirates.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Martin, “that is a capital reason, and
it is brave; you can defend yourselves, and not have
to go sneaking from port to port, every now and then
having to creep in and out the inlets of the coast, to
avoid the rogues. I tell you what, Prabu, I hope I
shall see them used. I should like to have a good fight
with those ugly, pig-tailed men of Fokien, and the
Ladrones. Shouldn’t you, Claud?”</p>

<p>“No! Heaven forbid that we should <i>hope</i> to do
anything of the kind. If we are attacked, and can’t
help ourselves any other way, then it is another matter.
Besides, I agreed to go nest-hunting, not pirate-fighting.”</p>

<p>“Why, Claud, any one who did not know you as I
do would think you a coward.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Martin. While I <i>know</i> what
I am myself, I don’t care what ill-natured people may
choose to think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Well, well!” said Prabu, interposing, as if he feared
we were verging upon a quarrel; “let not my young
masters use harsh words to each other, for before the
prahu returns to Batavia, both may have their desires.
But,” he added, piously, “Allah forbid that we should
take the lives of others, except in defense of our own!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

<small>WE SET OUT ON OUR VOYAGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> voyage along the north coast was very tedious,
for the wind slackened towards the evening, and we
had no other amusement than watching the doings,
as well as we could in the distance, of the fishing tribes
and salt manufacturers who inhabit the shore. As,
however, it is upon these two arts the Javanese depend
in a great degree for their supply of food, and their
consequent well-being as a people, it was interesting
and instructive to observe how they pursued them.</p>

<p>The fishing-boats proceed to sea with the land-breeze
at an early hour of the morning, and return a
little after noon, with the sea-breeze. Their mode of
taking the fish is by drag-nets, and by traps or snares,
consisting of enclosures formed, with much skill and
labor, by driving stakes or palisades into the water of
several fathoms deep, on banks much frequented by
fish, and to which nets are secured. The river-fish
are taken, sometimes, by spearing, or by first stupefying
them, by throwing into the water a plant called
<i>tuba</i>, which possesses a strong narcotic property, by
which the fish become intoxicated, and float upon the
surface of the water, apparently dead, when they are
easily taken by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>As for the salt manufacture, it is chiefly carried on
in situations on the flat north coast, where the soil is
of a clayey nature, and free from dark loam—both
requisite qualities toward the success of the process.
The salt-water is admitted through a succession of
shallow square compartments, in each of which it receives
a certain degree of concentration, until, arriving
at the last, the water is completely evaporated; and
the salt left behind, requiring no further preparation,
is fit for immediate use.</p>

<p>Upon the south coast of the island, however, the
shelving nature of the shore, and the porous quality
of the soil, will not admit of the practice of this cheap
method. The natives have recourse, therefore, to the
following very singular process. The sand on the
beach being raked, and smoothed into the appearance
of ridges and furrows, as if intended for cultivation,
the manufacturer, having filled a pair of watering-cans
from the surge, runs along the furrows, sprinkling the
contents in a shower upon the ridges. In a few minutes
the powerful effects of the sun’s rays have dried
the sand, which is then scraped together with a kind
of hoe, and placed in rude funnels, over which is
thrown a given quantity of salt-water, by which a
strong brine is immediately obtained. The peasants
transmit this brine to their hovels, where it is boiled,
in small quantities, over an ordinary fire, and a salt
is obtained, which is necessarily impure, in consequence
of the haste with which the operation is performed;
thus the inferior salt costs fourfold as much as the
better product of the north coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>These industrious tribes of the coast also manufacture
saltpeter, by boiling the soil obtained from caves
frequented by bats and birds, chiefly swallows; the soil
itself being the decomposed dung of these animals,
which commonly fills the bottom of the caves to a depth
of from four to six feet. In this process, however,
the labor of the poor fellows is to a great extent
wasted, since the supply to be obtained is so precarious
and limited, and the cost of the niter consequently so
high, that saltpeter and gunpowder may always be
more cheaply imported from Bengal.</p>

<p>As I have said, the voyage along the north coast
was tedious in the extreme. As, however, we entered
the beautiful Straits of Sunda, when every mile’s advance
showed to us some one or other of the many
islands that embellish that region of perpetual summer,
and gave to our view a mountain range, or volcanic
peak, of the island of Java, our hearts became
filled with delight.</p>

<p>A stiff breeze wafted us merrily through the straits,
and in a few days we had rounded that magnificent
promontory, at the extreme west of the province of
Bantam, known to mariners as “Java Head;” but a
week’s run, however, along the south coast, and we
had become so short of water, that Prabu ran the
prahu into the first inlet or bay for a fresh supply. But
our captain had other matters of business ashore with
the chief of the village, so, leaving his lieutenant, Kati,
to see the casks filled, he landed, inviting my brother
and me to accompany him—an invitation we were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
unwilling to accept, if only to stretch our legs a little
while on land.</p>

<p>The village, which was about half a mile from the
sea, was a charming place—a veritable little human
paradise. It consisted of some sixty or seventy bamboo
cottages, neat and pretty, but the whole completely
screened from the scorching sun, and so buried in the
foliage of a luxuriant vegetation, that at but a short
distance no appearance of a human dwelling could be
detected; and in manners the inhabitants seemed no
less charming than their village, for no sooner had we
passed the belt of trees which led us into the wide
verdant space in the front of the cottages, than several
came forth from their houses, made obeisance, and
begged that, being strangers, we would honor them by
partaking of refreshment, and, if need be, a lodging
for the night. Indeed, so many and so pressing were
these offers, that, not knowing whose to accept, and
fearing to offend either by a refusal, we stood in some
dread of suffering in our stomachs from an <i>embarras
de richesse</i>. Prabu, however, rescued us from the difficulty
by picking out one man, with whom he seemed
to have had a former acquaintanceship. True, when
we did enter the house, we found nothing but rice,
fruits, and spiced-water; but, then, the warm-heartedness
with which they were offered rendered them more
welcome than would have been a banquet at another
time, at some other hands.</p>

<p>When we had partaken of our host’s hospitality—for
it would have been a breach of Javanese etiquette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to have done so before—Prabu desired to be conducted
to the chief of the village.</p>

<p>“The ‘Head-man’ is absent, hunting the buffalo,”
was the reply; “but the noble captain will honor his
servant by taking up this lodging in this house for the
night, and in the morning the chief will return to the
village, for it is a festival.”</p>

<p>“My brother is good, and his hospitality to strangers
will never be forgotten,” replied Prabu; “but the hands
are useless without the head; the captain must not
leave his ship;” and so, to the chagrin of the worthy
man, we returned to the prahu. The next morning,
however, we again visited the village, and found it
all bustle and excitement. It was a festival in honor
of the second marriage of one of the leading inhabitants.
The people were all out; the bride and bridegroom,
with their friends, for the greater part on
horseback, were parading the village, decorated in
their gayest attire, decked with jewels, and attended by
a band of music.</p>

<p>As the procession passed us, one of the bridegroom’s
friends or relations, recognizing in Prabu an old acquaintance,
fell out and invited him to the wedding-feast,
to which they were then proceeding.</p>

<p>“Won’t it be jolly?” said Martin; “we shall get a
look at the bride, for I could not see her just now
through the curtains of her litter.”</p>

<p>“There will not be much to interest us, I should
think; however, as it would be uncivil to refuse, we
will go,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Arriving at the house about an hour afterwards,
we were shown by one of the family into a large chamber,
around which were ranged five tables, covered
with dishes of curry, rice, and fish, with numerous
plates of sugar-cakes. Beyond this apartment was another,
very gaudily decorated, in which were sitting,
or rather squatting, around bowls of smoking rice, some
twenty venerable personages, probably the seniors of
the village. Seeing us approach, they good-humoredly
bade us be seated at their board. We complied, not
so much for the pleasure of partaking of the mess before
us, but with a natural curiosity to get a glimpse
of the happy couple. Martin, being the most curious,
was the first to espy them.</p>

<p>“See,” he said, “there they are; what a couple of
guys!”—and he bent his head in the direction of a
deep recess on one side of the apartment, where the
couple were sitting in silent, solemn state, like a pair
of stuffed images, it being the etiquette that they
should appear unmoved by whatever was passing. As
we quitted the house, Prabu told us a comical story
he had heard, touching that demure-looking, mummy-like
lady, during the feast.</p>

<p>In that part of Java, when a man marries a second
time, it is the custom, at one part of the ceremony,
for the bridegroom to advance towards the wife with
an ignited brand in his hand, which it is the duty of
the bride to extinguish by pouring water over it. Now,
this ceremony had been performed in the morning;
but the bride—a widow—finding a great difficulty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
quenching the flame, became so impatient that she
suddenly dashed the contents of the pitcher into her
lord’s face.</p>

<p>“And what did <i>he</i> do?” asked Martin, as angrily
as if he himself had been the damped husband.</p>

<p>“What <i>could</i> he do?—nothing,” replied Prabu.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t he, though! I tell you what, if it had
been me, I would have sent her packing—” but at this
moment his thoughts were turned in a very different
direction. “Hilloa! what is going on?”</p>

<p>The sight that called forth this remark was a great
number of men, women and children, seated in a ring
upon a grass-plot, watching the grimaces and gesticulations
of two men, each of whom, with a bundle of
rattan canes under his arm, was haranguing the audience,
at the same time that a band of music was playing.</p>

<p>“Come, Martin, there is nothing worth looking at
here,” said I, turning to walk away.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there, though! Why, these two fellows are
going to play singlestick,” he replied; and as he spoke,
two boys—naked, with the exception of a blue cloth
around their waists—stepped into the ring. Each of
them being presented with a cane, the men whom we
had heard haranguing the audience, and who now acted
as seconds, placed the lads face to face, at a yard’s distance
from each other, and ordered them to “begin.”</p>

<p>They did begin, as gracefully as fencing-masters,
first with a salute, which consisted in touching the
ground with the rods, and waving them to the spectators.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Next they approached nearer and each one,
placing his left hand on the other’s right shoulder,
raised his elbow till it nearly met that of his antagonist
overhead. In this attitude they frequently continued
for several minutes, eyeing one another with the keenest
attention, holding their canes extended in the right
hand, and watching for a favorable moment to strike.</p>

<p>“Bother!” exclaimed Martin, growing impatient;
“why don’t they begin? They look as if one is afraid,
and the other dares not.” But not so thought the spectators.
To them it was a moment of great excitement,
and as, to give effect to the scene, the music lowered its
tones so as only just to be heard, and the two seconds
withdrew to a distance of several paces, to leave the
ground clear for the combatants, they gazed with the
most eager and breathless anxiety.</p>

<p>For a time they continued to grapple each other, at
the same time performing a sort of waving or bending
motion with their bodies, while their feet described
circles on the grass; one or the other, seeing his opportunity,
gave his antagonist a violent blow, either
on the left side, or more generally on the calf of his
left leg, accompanying the stroke with a loud yell.
The instant the blow fell, its dealer sprang quickly
backwards, in order to escape retaliation from the
other, who was not slow to return the compliment,
which he, in like manner, if successful, graced with a
scream.</p>

<p>“That’s plucky!” Martin would exclaim, as each
blow fell, and its receiver accepted it without a cry or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the movement of a muscle. As for the spectators, at
every well-dealt blow, or dextrous avoidance of a
blow, they raised a savage yell of delight or admiration
that made my blood run cold. Now, I do not
care for such unnecessary exhibitions, any more than
I do for the brutal “noble science of self-defense,” as
it is called, and so I said, “Come, Martin, I have had
enough of this.”</p>

<p>“Bother!” again cried my brother, for he used the
expression whenever he was vexed; “if they were doing
each other any great harm, they would cry out.
They are only in play.”</p>

<p>He believed, however, that it was something more
than <i>play</i>, when, going into the ring after the contest,
we saw that in every instance where the blows had
taken effect, a gash, or, rather, a livid ridge of some
inches in length, had been left in the flesh.</p>

<p>The boys’ contest was followed by others between
men, but by both youngsters and oldsters the combats
were carried on with wonderful good temper, considering
their sufferings and their naturally hot blood. But
proverbially ferocious as are all the races akin to the
Malay, during these <i>games</i> they are not permitted to
wear dagger or creese, or, indeed, to show “temper.”
If ever a real quarrel arises out of these jousts, the
spectators rush into the circle, seize the squabblers,
and expel them in disgrace from the games.</p>

<p>But now I have to relate a most extraordinary incident—one
that was within an ace of abruptly terminating
the adventurous career of one of us two brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>The games had finished, and the warlike players
gone to their homes. The band, however, struck up
another tune, for the simple-minded villagers had congregated
round a conjuror just about to exhibit his
tricks, when Martin, impulsive at all times, began to
push his way through the throng, saying,—</p>

<p>“Come, Claud, let us get a good sight of this fellow.”</p>

<p>It would have been as well as if he had failed in
the attempt; for, no sooner did his eyes light upon the
conjuror, than, with a shriek more like that of some
wild animal than a human being, he darted towards
him, and, as the people came between them, he cried,—“Let
me get at the rogue!”</p>

<p>“The boy is possessed with an evil demon,” cried
the conjuror. This was sufficient for the superstitious
villagers, who scampered in all directions.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the break in the crowd, the
conjuror ran at the top of his speed through the village,
and toward the forest which it skirted. But
Martin was at his heels.</p>

<p>“Great Heaven, Prabu,” I cried, “my brother must
be mad;” and without another word we rushed after
him.</p>

<p>“Run, for thy brother’s life,” cried Prabu; “that fellow
is entrapping him into the wood, where he may
slay him!”</p>

<p>I wanted no such exhortation; but it seemed, indeed,
as if a supernatural speed had been lent both to
pursuer and pursued, for at every step they distanced
us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Martin! Martin! for Heaven’s sake stop; follow
not that man into the wood,” I shouted, and likewise
shouted Prabu; but it was useless. They reached the
forest, and we lost sight of them; still onwards, through
bush, underwood, and foliage, till we came to an open
space; then again we could see them, but, breathless,
we were compelled to rest for an instant. The fugitive
had also come to a halt, and leaned against a tree,
as if no longer able to continue his flight, at which my
brother gave a joyful shout, and then almost leaped
forward; but the other, permitting him to approach
within a yard, pulled forth from the fold around his
waist a cane about six feet in length, and, putting this
to his lips, the next instant a small dart or arrow
struck my brother in the arm; then, giving a hideous
laugh, the hunchback—for it was he—turned and
continued his flight with renewed vigor, still followed
by my brother.</p>

<p>“The poor boy will be slain!” exclaimed Prabu.
“Quick, for his life! Stop! in Allah’s name, stop!”
he shouted to Martin; “that arrow was poisoned!”
But there was no necessity now for shouting; for
suddenly, as if his strength had become exhausted, he
stood stock-still, and then fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>The instant we reached him, Prabu tore off his
jacket, and bared his arm. I could see nothing but a
small puncture, with a single drop of blood resting in
the wound; but Prabu, knowing the fatal consequences
of that trifling wound, if remedies were not immediately
applied, knelt down, and for several minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
sucked at it like a leech. Having done this, he bade
him get up.</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin, “let me alone. I wish to sleep;”
and, indeed, his eyes were closed. “I will go no further;
I will remain here.”</p>

<p>“If he sleeps within the next hour, he will never
wake more,” said Prabu.</p>

<p>This was enough for me. I helped to force him to
his legs.</p>

<p>“Martin! dear Martin! walk, run, make an effort!
it is for your life!” I cried; and sensible, but hardly
so, he did try; and so, getting him between us, and
each taking hold of an arm, we ran him back towards
the village. Fortunately, we soon fell in with two
native men, and Prabu, crying to them, “The upas!
the upas is in his veins!” they relieved us, and, being
in full strength, ran forward with him. We followed,
and Prabu went into the first cottage, and obtaining
a cup of strong rice-spirit, poured it down his throat.
The effect of this stimulant was very great, it revived
him, and made him sensible that his life depended upon
violent exercise, and, under Providence, his life was
saved; for, after having run him to and fro for about
an hour, he had shaken off that lethargy which, had
it continued, must inevitably have destroyed him; and
then, and not till then, we permitted him to enjoy a
natural sleep, from which, after several hours, he
awoke refreshed, and as well as ever.</p>

<p>“You have had a narrow escape,” said I, when he
awoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Yes, thanks to you, old fellow, and Prabu; but I
wouldn’t mind going through it all again—I mean the
terrible agony of being compelled to keep awake,
walk, and run, when I felt as if I could willingly have
given ten years of my life for a good sleep—if I could
only have secured that rascal, who killed our father.”</p>

<p>“But it would be useless, Martin; for, you know,
it is only a surmise; we have no proof,” said I, fearing
that he had some inclination to go hunchback-hunting
again.</p>

<p>“Aye, but we have proof that he robbed Ebberfeld’s
home—that he stole Marie!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, we shall come across him again some
day, and then we will force him to confess the whole
truth,” I replied; not that I did not feel as strongly
in the matter as my brother, but that I <i>knew</i> a word
from me would have induced him to go in search of
the snake-charmer. Fortunately, at that moment
Prabu, who had been to have an audience of the chief,
returned, and we all three at once made the best of our
way to the prahu.</p>

<p>But a few words with my readers respecting this
“upas-tree,” the juice of which nearly deprived me of
a brother. It is, in a great degree, deserving of its
bad reputation, no doubt; nevertheless, it is not by any
means so black as it has been painted, notwithstanding
all the nonsense that Monsieur Foerst, a French surgeon,
invented, and Dr. Darwin promulgated in England,
about it; for instance, that a particle of its juice,
being inserted into the human body, caused instantaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
death, and that the atmosphere for a vast radius
around the tree is fatal to animal life.</p>

<p>In the first place, the word “upas,” as applied only
to <i>one</i> tree, is a misnomer; for in the Javanese and
some other languages of the Western Archipelago,
the word is not a specific term, but the common name
for poison of any description whatever. Then, of the
plants of the Indian islands, two at least afford a most
subtle poison, either taken into the stomach or circulation—the
<i>anchar</i> and the <i>chetik</i>. The former, the
most common source of the vegetable poison in use,
is one of the largest forest trees of the Archipelago,
rising to the height of sixty or eighty feet, straight
and large, before it sends out a single branch. It
proves hurtful to no plant around it, and creepers and
parasitical plants are found in abundance about it. The
poison is in the outer bark, from which, when
wounded, it flows in the form of a milk-white sap. In
this state it is as deleterious as when, according to the
practice of the natives, it is mixed with the juices of a
quantity of extraneous aromatics and other matters,
such as black pepper, ginger, arum, galanga, etc.
When applied to the external skin, it produces intolerable
pain and itching, with a kind of herpetic eruption.
The inner bark resembles coarse cloth, and is
frequently worn as such by the poorer peasantry, and
occasionally converted into strong rope. Great care
must, however, be taken in preparing it; for if any
particles of the poisonous juice remain adhering to it
when the cloth becomes moist, the wearer experiences
intolerable itching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>The <i>chetik</i> is a large creeping shrub, with a stem
occasionally so big as to approach to the character of
a tree. It thrives in black, rich moulds. It is the
bark of <i>the root</i> of this plant which affords the <i>upas</i>
or poison, which is an extract of nearly the consistence
of syrup, obtained by boiling it with water. The
<i>chetik</i> is a more intense poison than the <i>anchar</i>, but,
as far as we know, it is confined to Java. The <i>anchar</i>,
on the contrary, appears to exist in almost every country
of the Archipelago, being found in the Malay
peninsula, in Sumatra, Borneo, Bali, and in Celebes,
as well as in Java. The Malays call this last <i>ipoh</i>.
Both are found only in the deepest recesses of the
forest.</p>

<p>To produce the fullest effects, the <i>upas</i> poison, of
either kind, must be recent and well-preserved; exposure
to the air soon destroys its potency; its effects
depend on the strength of the animal, and the quantity
taken. Three times the quantity taken into the circulation
are necessary to produce the same effects taken
into the stomach. The momentary application of a
small quantity to the blood does not prove fatal. It is
necessary that the poison be inserted with a dart; thus
applied, the poison of the <i>anchar</i>, in its recent state,
kills a mouse in ten minutes, a cat in fifteen, a dog
within an hour, and a buffalo—one of the largest of
quadrupeds—in something more than two hours. The
effects of the poison of the <i>chetik</i> are far more violent
and sudden. Fowls, which long resist the poison of
the <i>anchar</i>, die often in less than a minute from that
of the <i>chetik</i>. It kills a dog in six or seven minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>The train of symptoms induced by the operation of
the <i>anchar</i> are restlessness, quick breathing, increased
flow of saliva, vomiting, alvine discharge, slight
twitches, laborious breathing, violent agony, severe
convulsions and death. The <i>chetik</i> acts more directly
on the nervous system and brain, and after a few primary
symptoms, destroys life by one sudden effort.</p>

<p>Referring to the use of poisoned arrows, Mr. Crawford,
a long resident in the island of Java, says: “The
most barbarous of the Indian islanders, in their wars
with Europeans and each other, discharge arrows poisoned
with the juice of the <i>anchar</i>. These may, indeed,
produce an aggravated wound and much debility;
but I doubt whether the wound of a poisoned arrow
has ever proved <i>immediately</i> fatal.” Rumphius
describes the Dutch soldiers as suffering severely from
the effects of this poison in the wars conducted by
them, about the middle of the seventeenth century, at
Amboyna and Macassar, until a remedy was discovered
in the emetic qualities of the <i>Radix toxicaria</i> or
<i>bakung</i>. The assertion of the discovery of a remedy
throws a doubt upon the whole, for it is surely altogether
unreasonable to expect that clearing the stomach
by an emetic should prove an antidote to a subtle
poison taken into the circulation, and acting upon the
nervous system! The Dutch soldiers were probably
more frightened than hurt. In the perfidy of the practice
of using poisoned weapons, and the mysterious
and secret operation of a poison, there is something
to appal the stoutest heart, and abundant materials
for terror and superstition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>When the soldiers, both Indian and European, proceeded
on an expedition to Bali, in 1814, they expressed
serious apprehension for the poisoned darts of the
Balinese. The same fear was entertained by the same
people for the creeses of the Javanese, until we discovered
that that people never poisoned their weapons.
Such, unhappily for fiction, is the true account of the
<i>upas</i>-tree, the bark of which is used by the natives of
the countries in which it grows as wearing apparel,
and beneath the shade of which the husbandman may
repose himself with as much security as under that of
cocoa-palm or bamboo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>

<small>THE OLD HEAD-MAN, THE “STRONG ONE,” THE “HANDSOME
ONE,” THE “WEAK ONE.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Delicious</span> the climate, enchanting the scenery, of
the islands of the Indian Archipelago! crowded as they
are, from the water’s edge to their very summit, with
luxuriant foliage, and offering to the vision a richness
of tint unknown in other regions; nevertheless, to two
youngsters longing for activity, and the free and natural
use of their legs, a voyage along the coast-line of
Java, cribbed, cabined and confined in a comparatively
small craft, and manned by natives, who, either from
ignorance or obstinacy, insist upon hugging the shore
and never losing sight of land, was very monotonous.
Thus, when we came in sight of the cliffs Karong-Bolang,
in the province of Baglen, and Prabu told us
that the nests to be found in the bowels of these stupendous
rocks was the end and object of our voyage,
we gave three cheers—good, hearty Yankee cheers.
As for Martin, he was in an ecstasy of delight, for he
was about to become a “nest-hunter;” although, by
the way, the full meaning of these words in conjunction
neither he nor I then exactly comprehended.</p>

<p>“It is scarcely daybreak; we shall see flocks of swallows,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
said Prabu, as about that hour the prahu made
towards a creek.</p>

<p>“What! the little nest-makers, the purveyors-general
to the pig-tailed mandarins?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“My young master, yes!” replied Prabu; “for they
are night-birds, and leave not the caves till the sun has
disappeared.”</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, the vessel ran into the midst
of a tribe of these important little feathered animals.
They resembled the common swallow in form and
color, but, like Mother Carey’s chickens (the smallest
of the petrel tribe), seemed ever restless, ever in motion.
Sometimes they appeared to skim the water, as
if taking up some substance with the bill from the sea;
at others, darting, turning and twisting in the air, <i>as if</i>
after fleet-winged insects; but, curiously enough, although
my brother and I watched very keenly, neither
of us could detect anything in the air, or upon the surface
of the sea, upon which they could feed; so, turning
to Prabu, I said, “What <i>on earth</i> do they exist
upon?”</p>

<p>“Nothing upon <i>earth</i>,” replied Martin, laughing,
“but, like chameleons, upon air.”</p>

<p>“Upon insects,” said Prabu, “and little creatures
so minute, that, although your eyes cannot detect them,
float upon the surface of the sea.”</p>

<p>Then he explained to us that it was by some arrangement
of the digestive organs that the bird produces
from its bill the glutinous and clear-looking substance
of which its nest is constructed; an explanation, to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
certain extent, substantiated by the appearance of the
nests, which in structure resemble long filaments of
very fine vermicelli, coiled one part over the other
without much regularity, and glued together by transverse
rows of the same material. There was an old
notion, that these nests—which, by the way, in form
resemble the bowl of a large gravy-spoon, split in half
longitudinally—were formed from sea-foam and other
marine productions pulled up by the birds; but inasmuch
as the edible-nest is found not only at the seaside,
but in caves sixty or seventy miles in the interior,
Prabu’s hypothesis seemed the most correct; but, then,
to prove that, it should be discovered, by a skilful dissection,
that the bird has some peculiar organ destined
to perform the process of elaborating such a substance
from its food. At present, neither naturalists
nor natives make any distinction between the variety
of swallows which affords the esculent nest, or any
other.</p>

<p>As the prahu entered the creek, walled on one side
by a perpendicular rock of at least 600 feet in height,
Prabu made the blood run cold in our veins; for,
pointing to a small dark spot about 200 feet above
our heads, he said: “Yon hole is the entrance to one
of the caves, and can only be reached from the top.
What do my young masters think of nest-hunting
now?”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t think any more about it,” said I, with
a shudder. “<i>I</i> wasn’t born a bird, and it’s an occupation
only fit for eagles and Mother Carey’s chickens;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
or, at least, people ought to be invented with wings
and strong claws for the express purpose.”</p>

<p>“Queer!” said Martin, thoughtfully, and scanning
the rocks. “It’s a deuce of a height, or rather a depth,
to be let down, with no ledge or abutment to rest upon,
and this sea surging, foaming, and boiling in one’s
ear! But then,” he added, his eyes brightening up,
“it’s dangerous; it wants pluck, and that’s the thing
for me. No danger, no fun. Besides, others do it,
and, if so, why not me? I tell you what, Claud, we
white fellows mustn’t show a feather the same color
as our skin. Besides, we are always boasting about
being superior to these darkies; therefore, we must
prove now that we are at least their equals. We have
begun, and we must go on.”</p>

<p>“My young master,” said Prabu, good-naturedly
smiling at the allusion to the “darkies,” “does he know
that the men who gather the nests have been trained
from their childhood to climb rocks like tiger-cats,
and that even of these one out of every five loses
his life?”</p>

<p>“Bother! all right; don’t try to frighten a fellow.
As you Mahommedans say, ‘What is written <i>is</i> written,’
we have begun, and we must go on; what we
want in training, you know, we must find in pluck;
and if you come to that,” he added, boastfully, “I
sha’n’t fail—no, nor my brother, either, for all his
pretending to be afraid of this, that, and the other;
for in <i>his</i> quiet way, he is as plucky as any of us.”</p>

<p>“There is no real pluck, Martin,” said I, “in attempting
that in which we know we must fail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Ah! old fellow, but we never <i>do</i> know what will
be a failure till we try,” he replied; and as he would
have continued that line of argument the whole day,
I dropped the subject.</p>

<p>Shortly after daybreak we anchored in a small natural
harbor or bay, about half-way up the creek.
“Now comes the tug of war,” said Martin; adding,
“When do we commence, Prabu?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, at sunrise,” answered Prabu. “To-day
I must see the chief who guards the caves; but
my young masters can, if they please, come with me,
for they will find a welcome for the day and the night
in the village.”</p>

<p>Then, having given orders to Kati to send six of the
men to join us in the morning, bringing with them all
things necessary for the expedition, we followed
Prabu up a steep hill.</p>

<p>“Truly, this may be a village,” said Martin, when
we reached the top, “but it’s inhabited by the dead.”</p>

<p>My brother was right. It was a cemetery—one of
those cities of the dead, for the simplicity yet beauty
and taste of which, in laying out, the Javanese are not
surpassed by any people. The whole summit and portion
of the opposite slope of the hill was clad with a
verdant sward, and laid out in groves of samboza trees,
a plant which, even when young, from the fantastic
growth of its stem, has a solemn aspect. The little
mounds of earth, with their head and foot stones
strewn with flowers, at the root of each of these trees,
bespoke at once the last resting-place of a beloved one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and the pious care of the living. The flowers were in
all their freshness, for the previous day the festival
annually held in honor of ancestors had taken place.
On this occasion, the men, women and children, attired
in their best, repair to the cemeteries, and pass the day
in devotion; each family strews the tombs of its progenitors
with the flowers of the <i>salasi</i>, or Indian tulse,
a plant cultivated in great quantities for this express
occasion.</p>

<p>With like simplicity and good taste, and without
the extravagant superstitions of most Eastern nations,
do the Javanese (for the greater part Mahommedans)
conduct their funerals. But they are sufficiently curious
for description. The corpse is carried to the
place of interment on a broad plank, which is kept for
the public service, and lasts for many generations. It
is constantly rubbed with lime, either to preserve it
from decay or to keep it pure. No coffin is made use
of, the body being simply wrapped in white cloth. In
forming the grave, after digging to a convenient depth,
they make a cavity in the side at the bottom, of sufficient
dimensions to contain the body, which is there deposited
on its right side. By this mode the earth literally
lies light upon it; and the cavity, after strewing
flowers in it, they stop up by two boards, fastened angularly
to each other, so that the one is on the top
of the corpse, while the other defends it on the open
side, the edge resting on the bottom of the grave. The
outer excavation is then filled up with earth, and little
white flags, or streamers, are stuck in order around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>They likewise plant a shrub bearing a white flower,
and in some places wild marjoram; the women who attend
the funeral make a hideous noise, not much unlike
the Irish howl. On the third and seventh day, the
relations perform a ceremony at the grave; and at the
end of twelve months, that of <i>Legga batu</i>, or setting
up a few long, elliptical stones at the head and foot,
which, being scarce in some parts of the country, bear
a considerable price. On this occasion, they kill and
feast on a buffalo, and leave the head to decay on the
spot, as a token of the honor they have done to the deceased
in eating to his memory. The ancient burying-places
are called <i>krammat</i>, and are supposed to have
been those of the holy men by whom their ancestors
were converted to the faith; they are held in extraordinary
reverence, and the least disturbance or violation
of the ground, though all traces of the grave be
obliterated, is regarded as an unpardonable sacrilege.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour we lingered about that silent
city, hallowed by so many loving hearts. To me there
is ever a melancholy satisfaction in such places; they
recall to my mind the departed, and fix my thoughts
upon the future; but then I stood pondering over one
particular mound of earth, for it reminded me of my
mother’s grave, in that far distant American cemetery.
What changes had happened since my father, brother,
and I had stood, almost broken-hearted, at its side!
We had become aliens in a foreign land; a dearly-loved
father dead, perhaps foully slain—who knew?
an unknown uncle; a cousin, known long enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
have become endeared to us—all, all passed away!
With such ponderings my mind was absorbed; sighing,
sobbing, I had no thought but of my own sorrow,
when Martin, taking my arm, but with big tears trickling
down his own cheeks, said——</p>

<p>“Don’t, Claud, don’t! Be a man now!”</p>

<p>“Have men no tears, Martin, for the memory of
those they have loved?”</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps so,” he answered, wiping his damp
eyes. “Don’t! don’t! don’t! Let us think of the future:
we must not dwell upon the past—indeed we
mus’n’t!”</p>

<p>“You are right, dear brother,” I said, at length, recovering
myself. “But, Prabu, where is this village?”</p>

<p>“Yonder, my master,” he replied, pointing to a cluster
of houses upon another hill in the distance. “But
look!” he added; “beware!” and scarcely had we time,
I to clutch my pistol, and Martin and Prabu to draw
their creeses, when a huge wild boar, which had just
come from the wood at the bottom of the hill, came
tearing and grunting up the slope, followed by several
hunters.</p>

<p>“It is the chief!” cried Prabu, as an old man, spear
in hand, and in advance of his party, pursued the animal.</p>

<p>“Let us show him a bold front,” said Martin. And
as we prepared to receive him, the hog stood for a
minute, as if greatly astonished at meeting with such
an unexpected opposition.</p>

<p>“He is taking our measure,” said I, at the same
time aiming at the brute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Here, move aside,” cried my brother, brandishing
his creese; “this is the weapon to tackle master piggy
with; he is only grinning at that whipper-snapper pop-gun
of yours.”</p>

<p>“That thrust will save us further trouble, Martin,”
said I, as the old chief, who had now come within
reach of the hog, sent his spear into its side. But not
so; the weapon broke short off at the neck-head, and
piggy, giving one loud grunt, turned suddenly round,
and rushed into a neighboring thicket.</p>

<p>“After him!” shouted my brother; but the old gentleman,
in very angry tones, called to us to remain
where we were.</p>

<p>“Who are these,” he cried, “sons of burnt mothers,
that they should step between Datoo and his game?”</p>

<p>“Why, uncivil old person, we were going to help
you to the pig!” replied Martin; then, seeing the chief
stood looking at the thicket, he added: “It is the dog
and the manger over again; the old fellow will neither
kill the pig himself, nor let us.”</p>

<p>“Son of a dog!” cried the chief, “my spear is
broken, and Datoo dares not defile Blaber with the
blood of a hog.”</p>

<p>Now this Blaber, about the defilement of which he
was so sensitive, was his creese, and Martin, believing
it was only an excuse for want of pluck, said, as he
offered him his own weapon,—</p>

<p>“Well, I am not so particular; take this, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Allah reward you!” cried the chief, snatching the
creese, and, with all the agility of a hunter some half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
a century younger, he leaped into the thicket. The next
minute, there was a grunt, a scream; blood spurted
from the bush, and the chief came forth flourishing
the red steel in his hand, and, now in a much better
temper, went up to Prabu, saying,—</p>

<p>“Datoo is a dog, and a son of a dog, for he did not
before recognize his friend.” Then, by way of testifying
his joy at the meeting, he fell upon his neck, and,
after the manner of his race, <i>smelt</i> him—a mode of
salutation in Java equivalent to the touch by the lips
of the inhabitants of continental Europe.</p>

<p>“We will trespass upon thy hospitality one night
only, good Datoo, for to-morrow, at daybreak, we go
to the caves.”</p>

<p>“My house, my village, and all therein are my
brother Prabu’s,” was the reply; and then, turning to
Martin, he thanked him for saving his creese from defilement.</p>

<p>The Javanese almost idolize this, their favorite
weapon, like the knights-errant of old, giving them pet
names, and occasionally addressing them as if they
were endowed with understanding—yet why, except
from custom, is incomprehensible: it is not for its
venerable antiquity, for its use was not introduced
until nearly the beginning of the fifteenth century. It
it not so useful as the sword, for it is short, and most
generally crooked. With justice it has been described
as more fit for assassination than war. The creese
doubtlessly had its origin in a most unromantic cause,
the scarcity and dearness of iron; for in those countries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
where the metal is unknown, and without intercourse
with foreigners, it must necessarily be far more valuable
than gold itself—a fact sufficiently proved by the
histories of Mexico and Peru, wherein, although gold
and silver were as common as iron in other countries,
the more vulgar metal was never seen until the arrival
of the Spaniards. Indeed, had these two brave peoples
known its use, it is more than questionable that they
would have become, if at all, so easily the prey of their
invaders. Such was the origin of that apology for the
sword—the creese. Why it is continued in use after
the cause has ceased, is easily comprehended by those
who are aware of the obstinate adherence of barbarians
to ancient habit and custom, particularly in an affair in
which national pride and vanity are engaged.</p>

<p>Arriving at the chief’s house, the largest and best-built
in the village, the old gentleman gave us a formal
welcome, and bade us be seated—that is, squat
ourselves upon the bamboo flooring, and the slave
would bring us refreshments; but Prabu, having
looked around, as if disappointed at not seeing some
other persons present, asked, “How is it that my
worthy Datoo’s sons are absent when the Pangeran requires
their aid?”</p>

<p>Now this Pangeran, or Prince, was the owner or
proprietor of the nest-caves; and Datoo and his sons,
his born vassals, were keepers and guards of the caves
against robbers, and, as such, bound to render Prabu
any aid he might require whenever he came upon a
nest-gathering expedition. At the question Datoo appeared
at first a little surprised, but he answered,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“The Strong-one and the Weak-one are in the forest,
hunting the buffalo, and will return in time to render
aid to the noble Prabu. But let my worthy friend
delight his heart and please his eye, for the <i>Handsome
One</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> is here to welcome her betrothed;” and the frown
vanished from our captain’s brow, as a girl, pretty for
a Javanese, but yellow as saffron, entered the room,
when he arose, and, having addressed to her some
very pretty words, saluted by—well, not kissing, but
<i>smelling</i> her cheek.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was spent in preparing
for our expedition the next morning. At night we
slept together in the same room. As, however, it was
the first moment since entering the house we had seen
Prabu alone, Martin mischievously said:</p>

<p>“Prabu, you sly dog! you never told us you had a
sweetheart.” But our captain was sullen, and replied
not. Determined, however, to have his joke, Martin
continued: “The Handsome One is a beauty lovely
as the houris of Mahomet’s Paradise; but she is very
young—almost a child, Prabu.”</p>

<p>“<i>She has had her teeth filed</i>,” replied our captain;
but with that answer my brother was compelled to rest
content, for he would say no more. But I must explain.</p>

<p>This ugly custom of blackening the teeth is common
with the Asiatics, but it is the natives of the Archipelago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
alone who also file them. The practice as far
as regards the men, is equivalent among Americans to
throwing aside the boy’s dress and assuming that of
the man; and with the women, to that, perhaps, of our
young ladies making their first appearance at public
places. But it is always a preparation for marriage.</p>

<p>The operation is confined chiefly to the upper canine
teeth, the edges of which are filed down and rendered
perfectly even, while the body of the tooth is rendered
concave.</p>

<p>The person about to be operated upon is thrown upon
his or her back, and an old woman—a professor
of the art—grinds the teeth into the desired form with
a piece of pumice-stone. An indelible black is easily
given, after the loss of the enamel, by the application
of an oily carbon, procured by burning the shell of the
cocoa-nut. The two middle upper canine teeth are left
white, and sometimes covered with a plate of gold—the
contrast which they form, in either case, with the
jet-black of their neighbors being looked upon as highly
becoming. A few individuals, more whimsical than
the rest, have the teeth filed into the appearance of a
saw.</p>

<p>Thus, not only to be in the fashion, but to be regarded
as a real beauty, a Javanese must have his
teeth properly filed and blackened; for, say they, “men
and women ought not to have teeth like dogs and
monkeys.” And this saying, perhaps, suggests that
the ugly institution had its origin in a rude effort of
improvement, on the part of the first savage tribe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
began it, to distinguish itself from the beasts of the
field and those ruder than themselves, who nearly resembled
the former. Crawford gives us the following
anecdote, illustrative of Javanese public opinion upon
this “mode”:</p>

<p>“After the young Sultan of Java had had his teeth
duly filed and blackened, according to custom, one of
the chiefs asked me, with perfect earnestness, if I did
not think his highness’s looks <i>very much improved</i>,
and was surprised that I did not agree with him.
When the elder son of the Chief of Samarang—one
of the very interesting youths who were educated at
Calcutta—visited Bali, the Rajah of Blelleng, one of
the sovereigns of that island, was informed of the circumstance,
and asked his opinion of him. He approved
of his looks, manners and conversation; but added, ‘it
was a thousand pities his teeth were white!’”</p>

<small>WE DESCEND INTO THE NEST-CAVES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we awoke the sun was high in the heavens,
and our captain had quitted the room.</p>

<p>“Hilloa!” cried my brother. “Get up, Claud!
Make haste, or that fellow Prabu will leave us behind.”</p>

<p>“Not he,” said I, dressing very leisurely; “he has
gone to prepare for the gathering.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but he <i>will</i>, though—just to save us from risking
our property in the venture.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Martin—what property have
we?” I asked, taking his words quite literally.</p>

<p>“Why, our necks, to be sure. You call them property,
don’t you?” But at that moment Prabu came to
tell us the native gatherers were ready to set out for
the caves.</p>

<p>The party consisted of half a dozen of the prahu’s
men; the two leaders, Kati and Prabu; and an auxiliary
force of six of the villagers, who, from a lifelong
residence near the caves, were supposed to be
acquainted with every nook and cranny. The whole
party, with the exception of Martin and I (who, by
the way, were attired in loose jackets and trousers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Chinese grass silk), were naked to the waist, which
was girdled by a kind of sash, that secured their drawers.
Then each, ourselves included, had a small bag
suspended from the neck for the nests; a sharp billhook,
with which to cut a pathway through the jungle,
a long iron spike, a coil of roughly-made rope, strong
enough to support the weight of a man; a torch, made
of bark and the resins exuded from forest trees, and a
flint and steel. In addition, several of the villagers
carried two or three bamboo poles of considerable
length, and Martin and I had one pistol each, and one
creese between us, of which he was the custodian.
Thus equipped, we started upon our breakneck expedition.</p>

<p>A long tramp of three or four miles, through thick
jungle and tall grass, continually on the lookout for
deadly snakes, wading across running streams, now
and then falling into holes treacherously hidden by the
dank vegetation, and we reached the base of a precipitous
cliff; and there we came to a halt, not so much
to rest, as for Martin and I to hold an examination of
our clothes. “Our clothes” I said!—but we had left
the greater portion of them in the bushes and upon
the brambles, which had torn them from our bodies.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” cried Martin, after a fruitless effort
to readjust his upper garment; “we had better strip
to it, like the natives;” and in a minute he was bared
to the waist, and I had followed his example.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, we followed our guides up the
mountainous rock, but we had no small difficulty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
making anything like progress; for a stream which
flowed from the top rendered the ascent so slippery,
that for every two feet in advance we went one backwards.
The example, however, of the natives—who,
by the help of their pikes, were climbing slowly but
surely upwards, and resembled a school of aged monkeys
with walking sticks—urged us on, and at length
we reached the summit safe and sound, if I except
the state of our wind, which was so short that we were
obliged to throw ourselves upon the rock, and rest
before proceeding further.</p>

<p>The difficulties and dangers of that ascent, however,
dwindled into insignificance when, stretching ourselves
at full length upon the ground, and hanging our heads
over the precipice, we caught a glimpse of the task
before, or rather, beneath us.</p>

<p>Let the reader imagine a nearly perpendicular rock,
from the summit to the boiling sea which lashed its
base, some five or six hundred feet, and he will not
be surprised that, moving backwards and again getting
to my feet, I exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Born monkeys could never make that descent without
breaking their necks, Martin. The sight is enough
for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” he replied; “a hundred feet more
or less makes no difference, so that the rope is strong.”</p>

<p>“But, Prabu,” he said, “where are the caves?” I
could not see an opening of any kind.</p>

<p>“Let my masters watch the descent of the villagers,
and they will see them,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>The auxiliaries from the village were the first to go
over the side. Each man drove his spike into the
ground, very carefully and deeply; then, having secured
one end of his rope to the handle, threw the other
over the rock, and commenced the descent. Martin
and I, at full length, and with our heads over the precipice,
watched in astonishment the cat or rather monkey-like
ease and facility with which each let himself
down the rope; till, when within about a hundred feet
from the sea, and looking to us scarcely so large as
the animal to whom I have compared him, he bent his
knees, and placing the soles of his feet against the
rock, used it as a kind of springing-board, from which
he leaped a sufficient distance to obtain a momentum
that sent him, on his return, into a fissure or hole in its
side, which, by the way, we did not know was there
until we suddenly lost sight of the gatherer.</p>

<p>“After all, Claud,” commented Martin, “you see, it
is not so difficult.”</p>

<p>“For birds, monkeys, or these fellows, who are
trained to it from childhood, perhaps not,” said I; but
before my brother could reply, Prabu, pulling us back
by the legs, said:</p>

<p>“Are my young masters ready to make the descent?”</p>

<p>Now, from the very expression of his countenance,
I knew he thought we should refuse, and oh! how I
longed to do so; but then, who could have borne to be
set down “coward” by those grinning natives behind
me?—and so I resolved rather to risk my life. As for
my brother, he cried on the instant:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Ready! Aye, I should think so, Prabu, if you will
only make the rope taut round the spike.”</p>

<p>For an instant he appeared surprised, but then he
said: “You are brave lads, but too impatient; I will
descend first, so as to receive you at the mouth of the
cave, and Kati will stay here, keeping an eye upon the
cord and spike until you are landed safely.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said I, well satisfied with the arrangement,
and over the side went our captain; but he was
not so expert as his men, for ere he could “light”
at an entrance to a cave, he swung about in mid-air,
making several failures.</p>

<p>“Our friend is not so well up in his business as the
other fellows,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“He is a gallant fellow, notwithstanding. But see,
he has done it at last; and it is our turn now, Martin.”</p>

<p>“All right, Claud; I will go down first.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>

<p>This amiable dispute would have lasted some time,
but Kati, having hauled up Prabu’s rope, without one
word of notice, passed it round my chest, and under
my arm, saying:</p>

<p>“S’pose sahib’s hand come sore, so him can’t hold
tight, he no tumble now, for rope catchee.”</p>

<p>But however kindly intended, and much as I liked
caution in a general way, I felt annoyed at being
taken by our mahogany-colored companion for a milksop,
who was obliged to make the descent in a kind of
cradle, while the others used their hands only, and
said, angrily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Remove the rope, Kati; I will do as the others have
done. My hands are strong enough to hold it.”</p>

<p>But the latter, having once received his orders, you
might as easily have moved a mountain as have induced
him to swerve from them, even in a degree;
thus, as he very coolly continued to adjust the rope, so
that it should cause me the least possible inconvenience,
he replied:</p>

<p>“Umpossible; the cap’en say, young sahibs go like
dis, so go they mus, cos dere hands not buffalo horn,
like dark man’s, but all soft like cat’s paw—rope cut
’em in bits.”</p>

<p>But more vexatious still was my brother, who seconded
Kati’s affront:</p>

<p>“Come, Claud, old fellow,” said he; “the strap is
on, it is no use kicking. Go on, Kati must obey orders;
besides, it is the safer plan after all.”</p>

<p>This speech surprised me, for most assuredly, had
he been seized in that rude fashion, he would have
been obstreperous enough. The truth, however, was,
that delighted at my risk being lessened, he swallowed
his own pride, and resolved to submit himself to the
same undignified if not (the natives being bystanders)
somewhat humiliating ordeal.</p>

<p>Well, over I went, keeping my eyes upwards, and
feeling the cliff with my feet, and so, hand after hand,
let myself down; but about half-way, I struck my head
so violently against a projecting piece of rock, that I
believe I should have let go the rope but for a cheer
from Martin above, and another from Prabu beneath;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
so at length I felt myself suddenly clutched by the
legs and dragged into the cave—of course, by Prabu,
who had been standing upon a small, narrow ledge
for the purpose. After a similar manner, but with
greater speed, descended Martin, who, as he landed,
cried:</p>

<p>“Bravo us! You see we have done it, Claud, and it
is no great matter after all.”</p>

<p>“Aye, Martin, the coming down is all very well;
but the getting up again? How, in heaven’s name,
shall we manage that?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he, laughing, “that will come all right.
As for me, I shall make my way up the same as the
natives; and you, you know, we can haul up between
us.”</p>

<p>When Kati, and all those of the prahu’s men who
were not stationed above, at the spikes and ropes, to
prevent their being tampered with, had descended,
Prabu leading the way, we moved toward the interior
of the cave. At the entrance the scent had not been
agreeable, but as we progressed the stench became
almost intolerable—so much so, I could not forbear an
exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” cried Martin—“adventurers mustn’t
have too fine noses; we shall get used to it in time.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said I, “as eels do to skinning—at the last
gasp.” But my brother was right, or other causes soon
made us forget the nuisance.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the cave appeared to widen; but
as, at every step, we had been leaving the light and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
wind behind us, it was now both prudent and necessary
to appeal to flint and steel. Two torches were
therefore at once lighted by Prabu and Kati, when a
din assailed our ears that could be compared with nothing
mortal. The little swallows in regiments, nay battalions,
left their nests, loudly chirping their astonishment,
and flapping their wings with indignation;
while hundreds, perhaps thousands, of huge bats
darted frantically to and fro, and, swooping down in
their anger, literally smacked our faces and boxed our
ears with their wings. Almost stunned with the hideous
sounds—sounds rendered almost supernatural by
the echoes of the cave—I placed my fingers in my ears;
but removing them again, the noise sounded as demoniac
as looked that mass of darkness, gilded by the
deep red glare of the two torches.</p>

<p>“Our small friends seem taken by surprise,” said
Martin, who regarded it all as good fun. “Hilloa!
that’s not civil,” he added, as a bat flapped his great
wings in his face.</p>

<p>“They will soon make their way out to sea,” said
Prabu. But as the last covey of bats, probably aroused
by the noise made by the others, came, as it were,
tumbling one over the other in their haste to escape
from the cavern, they blundered against the torches,
and we were at once in total darkness.</p>

<p>“How stupid of the winged brutes!” exclaimed my
brother.</p>

<p>By the time, however, the torches had been again
lighted, the noisy little animals seemed to have made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
their way to the sea, and then Martin said, regrettingly:</p>

<p>“What a pity we didn’t have a shot at those swallows!
We could have brought down a hundred of
them.”</p>

<p>“It would have been a cruel and wanton destruction
of life,” said I.</p>

<p>“My young master is right,” said Prabu, who took
a purely business-like view of the matter. “You
would have destroyed the creatures who make the
nests.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see, it would have been like killing the
goose who laid the golden eggs,” said Martin; and
Prabu, who had never heard that celebrated legend,
taking the words literally, replied:</p>

<p>“A wonderful bird that, my master. Her nests
would bring more dollars than these.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, indeed,” returned Martin, saucily.
“It is only a pity one don’t know where they
roost.”</p>

<p>“But anyhow, Prabu, we <i>might</i> have killed a few
of those bats.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, “or any of the swallows
which build near the entrance of the caves.”</p>

<p>“But why those? Are they less valuable, only because
they build in the interior?”</p>

<p>To this Prabu replied, by explaining that there were
two species of swallow in the caves—one that produced
the edible-nests, another that built near the entrance,
but which were always at enmity with their more valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
neighbors, whom they were in the habit of disturbing
and attacking.</p>

<p>Advancing, torch in hand, Prabu led us to what at
first appeared to be the furthermost end of the cavern;
but suddenly placing himself upon all-fours, or rather
<i>all threes</i>, for in one of his hands he held the torch,
he crept through an aperture barely large enough to
admit one person. We followed, and then found ourselves
in what, from the sound, for we could not see,
seemed to be a very large excavation in the rock.
Here two other torches were lighted, and being fixed
in the earth—which, by the way, seemed entirely
formed of guano, or the dung of the swallows—the
whole party began to unpack their bamboo poles.
These they lashed securely end to end, till they had
constructed between them six poles, each of the enormous
length of ninety or one hundred feet. I looked
on with surprise, for the purpose of these bamboos
had not occurred to me till now. By means of these
the natives would ascend to the nests, which are invariably
placed near the top of the caves.</p>

<p>The poles being completed, Prabu, Kati, and four
others, placing them upon their shoulders, followed
four men, who waved lighted torches above their
heads, as if to see in which spots the nests most
abounded. Experience, however, must have been their
greatest friend, for the eye could not pierce the opaque
mass between them and the roof. No, it was only
when the places had been chosen, the poles fixed, and
each man, torch in hand, and by aid of deep notches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
cut in his pole, had clambered to its utmost height,
that we could see the vast size of the cave in which
we stood; and which, by the way, we afterward discovered
was used by the gatherers as a habitation during
the nesting-season.</p>

<p>As, before permitting Martin and I to descend to
the caves, it had been Prabu’s policy to let us first
watch the natives, so he insisted that we should study
the monkey-like facility with which his men clambered
up the poles and remained thereupon, before he would
permit us to attempt the same feat.</p>

<p>For some time we complied, but, then, nest-gathering
is so tedious a process that we became impatient
of waiting, and resolved to try our hands. Thus, we
took up some of the spare bamboos, and began to lash
them together; but, comprehending our intention, one
of the natives told us that it was useless, for there were
no more stations for poles in that cave.</p>

<p>“Then look you, my friend, we will try another
cave,” replied Martin. “For I take it,” he added—as
he pointed to a barely distinguishable opening in the
rock, at a short distance from where we were standing—“that
hole is the entrance to a cavern of some
kind. At any rate, we will explore it.”</p>

<p>“S’pose sahibs go dere, dey no come back; no man
ebber do ’scape dat cave ob debels.” Then, to frighten
us the more (at least, so we thought), he told us that,
during the last nesting-season, three villagers had,
against the wishes of their friends, entered the cavern,
but that they had never since been heard of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Bother! what fudge!” cried Martin, rudely. “At
any rate, Claud,” he added, “we can leave the poles
here, while we first have a look at the interior, and so
judge for ourselves.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, regardless of the many well-meant
warnings, we lighted our torches and passed through
the fissure; and in that instance I was as wrong-headed
or obstinate as my brother, for I led the way.
At the time I felt rather surprised that Prabu, even
from the top of the pole at which he was perched, did
not descend and stop our departure; for had he but
glanced downwards, and seen our lighted torches, he
must have known we were about entering the cave terrible
even to the most daring of the nest-hunters. But
afterwards I found that the thoughts, both of Prabu
and Kati, were absorbed in their occupation; for, unexpectedly,
they had fallen upon what miners would
call a new vein—<i>i. e.</i>, a cluster of the finest white or
<i>cock’s nests</i>. But that you may the better comprehend
the value of their discovery, I must explain that as an
article of commerce, the quality of the nest is determined
by several circumstances; for instance, the nature
and situation of the cave, its extent, but, above all,
the time at which the nest is taken. The best are those
gathered in deep, damp caves, and before the birds
have laid their eggs; and in a superlative degree are
those of the cock-birds, who, having a separate establishment
from that of their wives and children, are
not so much soiled as those of the lady-birds, with
whom reside the little feathered people. Upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
other hand, the coarsest and least valuable nests are
those obtained after the birth and short-clothing of
the children—these being dark-colored, and streaked
with infantine feathers. I may here notice one singular
fact connected with nest-gathering: it is, that although
they are collected twice a year, providing no
unusual and violent injury be offered to the cavern,
they yield as productively as if left altogether unmolested
for two or three years. So, you see, the birds
speedily recover from their fright and indignation at
the loss of their homesteads.</p>

<p>But to return to my narrative. Upon entering the
opening, we found it so narrow that it was with difficulty
we could walk in single file; nay, at every step,
one shoulder or the other grazed the sides, causing a
most unpleasant sensation—a kind of dread that the
walls would collapse, crushing us between them; and
thus contracted did we find them for a distance of at
least a quarter of a mile, but then we came to an opening
of about double the width on the right-hand side;
and, foolish as it may seem, and as it really was, we
chose to enter that path only for its greater width.
But no—we had another motive; there was a slight
wind.</p>

<p>“That breeze indicates a large open space somewhere
ahead—probably the cave for which we are in
search.”</p>

<p>“We cannot do better, Claud; let us go on,” said my
brother. “But stay,” he added; “for fear we may be
suddenly parted, I will light my torch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“No, no,” said I, “mine will be sufficient; keep yours
in reserve. It would be unwise to use two at a time.”</p>

<p>“What a prudent old boy you are, Claud! But go
on,” said Martin.</p>

<p>We did go on—and on, until we came to another
opening, wider still than the one we were then in,
and also upon the right-hand side.</p>

<p>“Shall we go down here?” said I, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes—always to the right; and keeping that in
mind, we shall find no difficulty in returning,” said
Martin.</p>

<p>Again onwards—but about two hundred yards further,
finding four different openings, three upon one
side, and one upon the other, I came to a halt, and
expressed my doubts as to the prudence of passing
further; but Martin laughed at my indecision.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” said he, “we won’t stop now; this
poking about in the dark is capital fun.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” I replied, leading the way, “to the
right again.”</p>

<p>“By Jingo, here’s a breeze!” exclaimed Martin, as,
after about five minutes, a cold cutting wind whistled
through the passage, nearly extinguishing the torch.</p>

<p>“Yes; and now, I believe, the cave cannot be far
away. If, however, we do not soon fall in with it, I
shall return, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” answered my brother. “But go on, we
must find this cave before the light burns too low; for
my torch is shorter than yours, and will scarcely serve
to light us back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Again we advanced, but now we had to make way
against a strong head-wind. Then, instead of having
to walk upon guano, as in all the other passages, there
was beneath us the rock alone, all slimy and slippery.
Moreover, water kept continually dripping from above,
by which we guessed we were beneath the porous bed
of a hill-stream. But now I have not related the greatest
difficulties of that passage. Not level, like the
other channels in the rock, it was a rather steep ascent—not
so steep as that which we had climbed, but more
slippery, in consequence of the ever-dripping water,
and that, too, from a height of at least fifty feet. Still
keeping onwards, and upwards, holding my torch so
that it threw a light some yard or two ahead, I suddenly
stopped. There was a chasm before us, the
darkness of which was impenetrable.</p>

<p>“I wonder how deep it is,” said Martin, throwing
a large stone into it. But, judging of the great depth
by the lapse of time before we could hear the splashing
of the stone in some water at the bottom, I began to
tremble.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t go any further,” said I.</p>

<p>“Never say die, old fellow; that hole may be very
deep, but then we have to jump across—not down; so
here goes.” And before I could stay him, he stood
upon the other side. True, it was not three feet wide,
but, then, I feared, as in fact it proved, that it was but
an indication of others to come. Nevertheless, as my
brother had crossed, I followed; and again, because of
being torch-bearer, taking the lead, went forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
But now we seemed to have reached the apex of this
emboweled hole, for our pathway was downwards,
and the water from above more copious, coming down,
in fact, like small rain.</p>

<p>“Stop, Claud,” cried my brother, suddenly. “I
think I can hear the rustling of wings, as if of frightened
birds.”</p>

<p>Listening for a few seconds, I said, “I think so too,
Martin; then we can’t be far from the cave. Come
along.” But scarcely had I spoken the words when
there came a sudden roar,—a gush of wind,—and we
were in total darkness. Moreover, by some mishap,
the torch itself slipped from my hand into a pool of
water.</p>

<p>“Wait, Claud—don’t move; I will light my torch,”
said Martin.</p>

<p>“No—no; <i>you</i> wait one minute—mine is not far
off.” So saying, I walked stealthily downwards, trying
to feel for the torch with my feet. I must have
walked, I suppose, about three yards, when suddenly
the ground seemed to recede from under me. I fell
forward—a violent blow on the head—my ears sang,
and like a shuttlecock I seemed to be knocked to and
fro, from one battledore to another. Yet all this must
have been the sensation of a few seconds.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br>

<small>MY ADVENTURES IN THE NEST-CAVES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> shall I describe my feelings when returning
consciousness first made me fully aware that some terrible
accident had happened! I opened my eyes wide,
stretched them wider still, but all around was dark—black.
I could see nothing: then a racking pain in
the head made me attempt to raise my hand, but my
arm was so stiff, it refused its office. I tried the
other,—it was worse. Alarmed, I essayed to get upon
my feet, and that effort told me I was sore and
bruised from head to feet; and then I could realize
a notion of the phrase, “being beaten to a jelly,” except
that my limbs were stiff instead of elastic. What
could it all mean?—a dream, a nightmare surely! But
no—the aching head and limbs sufficiently disproved
that. At the highest pitch of my voice, I shouted for
my brother, but echo alone mocked my call; and then
the whole truth flashed across my mind—the going
through the passages in the rock. I must have fallen
into a chasm, and probably had only been saved from
an instantaneous death by the soft guano upon which
I was lying. My life saved!—but for what? To die
a lingering death by starvation; my only hope being,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
that Martin might find his way back to Prabu and his
men, and bring them to my assistance. Yes—I had
another hope: by the touch, the scent, I <i>knew</i> that I
was lying upon guano. If so, I reasoned the cave
must be one frequented by the swallows. It was
therefore probable that some of the gatherers might
come there; but remembering that the natives entertained
a superstitious horror of that cavern,—for I
did not doubt that it was the one for which we had
been in search, and from which it had been said that
no man had ever been known to return,—I sickened
with despair.</p>

<p>For a time I lay pondering upon the possibility of
some person or persons coming to my help. But
then, I murmured, this is childish, foolish, to await
here the coming of others, when I should be endeavoring
to help myself; and I made another effort to get
up. This time I succeeded. Moreover, I was agreeably
surprised to find that, although sore, stiff, and
bruised, my limbs were really not so bad as they had
felt—that is, I could use them. I endeavored to walk
forward, but there was some obstruction. Putting my
hand forth, I found that it was nothing more formidable
than a great heap of guano, drifted into that
form, probably, by the wind during the monsoon.
Aye, there <i>was</i> another faint hope: through the opening
by which the wind that formed that great heap
had got <i>in</i>, I might find my way <i>out</i>, and to discover
it became my object; but suddenly, a murmuring
sound fell upon my ears—it reverberated through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
cavern. I threw myself upon the ground to listen—it
was plainer. Oh, joy! it was the sound of human
voices, and in my delight I was about to shout to the
new-comers. But—well, I know not why—I did not;
and fortunate, most fortunate, for me that I refrained.
In a few minutes a pale light illumined the other end
of the cavern, by which I could see that it was larger—three
or four times as large—and more than double
the height of any I had seen hitherto. My attention,
however, became at once fixed upon the men. There
were four in all, each carrying a torch, by the light of
which I could see without being seen; and the sight
convinced me of the wisdom of my caution in not having
made known to them my presence, for they were
not of Prabu’s party. Then who could they be? A
moment’s thought, and I came to the conclusion that
they were nest-<i>robbers</i>, and in all probability villagers,
who had been the first to discover this new and evidently
rich cavern, and that, too, by some hitherto
unknown path in the rocks. Then another gleam of
light flashed through my mind. In all probability, it
had been these men who had disseminated the absurd
report, which had made other and legitimate gatherers—<i>i. e.</i>,
those authorized by the proprietor—shun it;
and thus the Pangeran, who was lord of that district,
was being plundered of a wealth, of the very possession
of which he was ignorant.</p>

<p>“But,” asks the reader, “what mattered it to thee
whether they were smugglers or honest men, since
Providence had sent them to thy rescue?” Aye, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
it mattered much; for if the former, they would
scarcely have hesitated an instant about putting to
death one who had discovered their secret, and thus
it behooved me to be upon my guard. Literally, liberty
and death were equally balanced, and it depended
upon my prudence or cunning which should turn the
scale. Accordingly, I again lay down behind the
guano, to work out in my mind what course to take,
or at least to watch my opportunity, and keep my eyes
and ears open.</p>

<p>Severely was my patience tested. For seven hours,
as well as I could guess the time, three of those fellows
continued their labors, each mounted upon his
bamboo pole; while the other—who, from the tone in
which they addressed him, seemed to be a slave or
servant—from time to time, as the occasion required,
relighted or renewed their torches. My position,
however, was fraught with terrible anxiety. What
would be the end of it all? There were men who
could save my life if they would, but to whom I dared
not make my presence known—men, indeed, who
would, in all probability, regard my death as necessary
to their own safety. My first hope was, that all
four would have ascended the poles, and that then,
taking advantage of their employment above, and the
darkness beneath, I could creep noiselessly along the
soft guano to the aperture by which they had entered;
but, alas! as I have told you, one was left below, and
he kept flitting to and fro, torch in hand.</p>

<p>Well, at length the three descended, and piled their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
bags upon a great heap of nests, the result of many
previous days’ labor. Now came another fright!
They would depart, of course, taking with them the
rope or ropes by which they had descended. Alas!
I had no hope; for although they would doubtlessly
return the next day, and the next, it could not alter my
position. I had but a choice of deaths—starvation or
assassination. Yes—there was one faint chance left.
I might, after they had left, discover a hiding-place in
the entrance, in which I could await until they had
passed the following day into the cavern and commenced
their labors, then reach the top by means of
their rope. But again, supposing even that I succeeded
in gaining the top, I should have to fight my
way past the man who, in all probability, would be
on guard at the rope. However, be that as it might,
I determined to accept the risk, for it was my only
chance of escape. But again was the cup dashed from
my lips, for, as the men were about quitting the cave,
another entered.</p>

<p>“My masters,” he said, addressing the gatherers,
“ye may, on your return homewards, take no sign
of your late occupation with you. Such are the orders
of the Head-man to his children, for the Pangeran’s
captain, Prabu, and his crew are even now nest-gathering
in the caves, and he loves not those who encroach
upon his master’s rights.”</p>

<p>The gatherers were taken by surprise, and gave
vent to their indignation in no measured terms; but
most extraordinary to me, at least until I saw his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
face, was the conduct of the servant. At the very
name of Prabu he trembled violently, and, begging
that they would leave him what water and rice remained
of the store they had brought with them in
the morning, said he would stay in the cave, until
Prabu and his companions had quitted the village.
Who could this man be, that he should so tremble at
the very name of Prabu? Who, indeed? However,
the gatherers must have known full well his reason
for avoiding my captain; for, at once complying with
his request, they quitted the cavern, and I very speedily
shared their knowledge.</p>

<p>A full hour elapsed after their departure ere I
ventured to commence operations—not, indeed, till the
slave, having partaken of his rice and water, stretched
himself at full length upon the ground, to sleep, as he
thought, in perfect security. Then, as his face was
turned towards me, and the red glare of a fresh-lighted
torch fell upon it, I started with surprise, for
I recognized at once the Chinese thief To-ki.</p>

<p>The hunchback—my father’s death—the abduction
of Marie—all passed through my mind. My blood
boiled indignantly; but thank Heaven, I murmured,
a little prudence, and a clue to that mystery will be in
my hands. The surprise and anxiety to escape did me
good—at least, made me forget my soreness and
bruises. When, from his hard breathing, I knew the
fellow was asleep, with pistol in hand at half-cock,
I stealthily advanced towards one of the bamboo
poles, and untying the cord from the lower joint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
made a noose at one end; then, creeping towards my
friend, and gently lifting his head and neck, I slipped
it over his arms, and gave it one quick, violent jerk.
The rogue awoke with a scream of fright. He could
not, however, <i>see</i> the cause of his little difficulty, for
I had thrown him upon his stomach, and was sitting
astride his back, twisting the other end of the cord
round his legs, as methodically as if I had been packing
a box or trunk. During the operation Mr. To-ki
struggled, screamed, cried, implored, and appealed to
the god Fo, and the spirits of his ancestors, to come
to the aid of the unfortunate To-ki, who was suffering
at the hands of an evil demon (meaning me); but
finding the ill-natured ghosts did not even return him
a civil answer, he prayed of my demonship to let him
off that time, and he would repent his sins, and for
the future forego his evil practices; but getting no
reply to this, he then appealed to me as the demon of
the cave, and implored me to forgive him for robbing
the place, saying in words to the following effect:</p>

<p>“The good demon is great, and will not condescend
to punish the smallest of the small—the least of the
very little—the insignificant To-ki! No, Mr. Demon,
the wretched To-ki is not so bad as he seems. It is
true that he is found in thy cave; but he was as the
limb to the head, nothing but a poor slave, compelled
to do the bidding of his masters.”</p>

<p>The superstitious wretch could not conceive the
possibility of his being in the hands of a mortal, and
it was as well for my purpose that he could not, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
thus I might wring from his fears some information
about Marie. Thus, in deep tones, and at the same
time placing the cold barrel of the pistol upon his
neck, I said:</p>

<p>“To-ki is a very great rogue, who has been guilty
of so many crimes that the soles of his feet must no
longer be permitted to soil the earth. It is written
that he must die.”</p>

<p>Quivering in every nerve, and trembling in every
muscle, the coward gave a piteous moan of despair.
“Die,” he whined, “among these rats of Javanese,
and my bones be placed kingdoms away from the
tombs of my ancestors! Alas! To-ki was born a
wretch thus to have incurred the anger of the
Demon!” Then, as a last appeal, he cried, “Can the
miserable To-ki make no atonement for the past, no
promises for the future, to induce the merciful demon
to prolong his life only till he can carry his body
where it may be laid in the tomb of his fathers?”</p>

<p>“So vile hath been thy sins, O To-ki, that the
ghosts of thine ancestors—that is, if they are ghosts
of good reputation—would kick thy bones out of
their tomb as a disgrace! Nay, it is also written that
thine own tomb shall never be swept.”</p>

<p>At this nonsense the superstitious fellow groaned in
despair, and at length, by way of propitiating my
demonship, and so getting me to put a good word or
two in for him with the ghosts of his forefathers,
he offered to confess his sins. This being exactly
what I had been fishing for, I said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“The wretch To-ki was one of the thieves who
robbed the house of Mynheer Ebberfeld!”</p>

<p>“He was! he was—but then, good Mr. Demon, he
was the slave of Huc-cuk.”</p>

<p>“For what vile purpose, besides robbery, did Huc-cuk
and his companions break into the house?”</p>

<p>“Truly, <i>that</i> must be known, as all things are, to so
great and wise a demon.”</p>

<p>That answer was a poser; for it was only reasonable
that my demonship should know all things—past,
present, and future. Nevertheless, after a moment’s
thought, I continued, as I again rubbed the cold iron
of the pistol against his neck:</p>

<p>“It is true that all the deeds of the wretched To-ki
are known, but he must confess them aloud: so, if he
would not have his bones forever rest in this cave,
let him speak. For what vile purpose, besides robbery,
did Huc-cuk enter the house?”</p>

<p>“To steal away the girl,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Wretch! didst <i>thou</i> have aught to do with the
slaying of that poor girl?”</p>

<p>“To-ki has been a rogue,” he replied, “but his hands
are not stained with blood. The girl was not slain;
she is alive even now.”</p>

<p>What a weight was removed from my heart!</p>

<p>“Then,” I asked, “for what purpose did Huc-cuk
take the girl from her home?”</p>

<p>“Alas! good Mr. Demon, thy slave knows only that
Huc-cuk carried her to the foot of the Blue Mountains,
where he was met by those who employed him,
and into whose hands he gave her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“Who and what were the names of the men who
received the girl from Huc-cuk?”</p>

<p>“Alas! of that also is the miserable and insignificant
To-ki ignorant, but, like him, they were slaves and
tools in the hands of a master.”</p>

<p>This answer was vexatious, and again I plied him
with questions, but nothing more could I elicit. I did,
however, find out that some time before he had fled
from the hunchback, and had taken service with one
of his countrymen, a merchant engaged chiefly in the
bird’s-nest trade, and that the latter—as big a rogue
as himself—had sent him, as one of the crew of a
junk which was then at anchor off the coast, to receive
the nests gathered by the cave-robbing natives
with whom he was in league.</p>

<p>Finding I could obtain no further information, I
got off his back; and although I knew that he could
scarcely move, I threatened him with speedy death
and the vengeance of the whole community of demons,
in which he believed, if he dared to turn his face upwards
until he had my permission.</p>

<p>Passing through the opening, I found myself standing
upon a narrow ledge of rock, with a rolling sea
at a great distance beneath, but not more than a hundred
feet from the summit. As I had anticipated, the
gatherers had left their rope, by means of which, and
at the cost of much pain, I ascended.</p>

<p>The coast was clear—not a living soul to be seen.
So far, so good. But where was I? Well, to ascertain,
I clambered up the highest peak to survey the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
surrounding country, in the hope of discovering the
whereabouts of the village; but no sign of human
habitation met my eyes. No—naught but hill, dale,
and thick jungle. The shades of night could not, I
knew, be far off, but which way to turn puzzled me.
I dared not remain—I feared to advance. Upon
chance alone must I depend for assistance, and thus I
invoked its good offices. Having a dollar in my
pocket, I threw it into the air, resolving that head or
tail should decide. If the former, I would proceed
straight ahead; if the latter, I would take a direction
totally the reverse. Straight ahead it was, and straight
ahead down the hill I went, till I entered a wood:
many of the trees were groaning beneath the weight
of delicious fruits, upon which, I need scarcely say,
I banqueted ravenously. A walk of about an hour
brought me to a limpid stream: here I refreshed my
inner man with copious draughts taken upon all-fours,
and my outer by a luxurious bath; and now, if I had
had no fear of such denizens of the woods and jungles
as tigers and snakes, I felt strong enough to walk
the night through; but even as it was, the remembrance
that I still possessed a pistol and two or three
charges gave me courage. So away I marched, endeavoring,
by whistling a tune, to delude myself into
a belief that I feared nought that could happen.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, however, my courage was put to
the test. There was a rush in the surrounding jungle—a
tiger, probably—at least, so I feared (for then I
had never seen one of the brutes), and at once I began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
to scramble up the trunk of a large durian-tree
near at hand; but there was as much danger from
above as from below, for I had disturbed a school or
family of monkeys, who, chattering and screaming,
hurled the fruit at me. Luckily, the animals were not
skilled in taking aim, for a blow from one of them
from any height must have stunned me; and so I safely
fixed myself astride a large branch some twenty feet
from the ground, in a position in which I could see
without being seen; and the next instant a noble buck
bounded forth and fell dead at the foot. It had a spike—the
spike of a nest-gatherer—in its side, the owner of
which, almost simultaneously, knelt by the body of
the slain animal. The sight of a man made my heart
rejoice; but when in the hunter I recognized Prabu,
my joy knew no bounds. Sliding down the trunk, I
was the next instant in his arms—yes, literally in his
arms, and being hugged, too, with hearty goodwill.</p>

<p>“God is great! But did my young master drop out
of the moon?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, only out of a durian-tree,” said I. But then
Prabu’s men and my brother came running through
the opening made by the deer and its slayer. The
former, at first believing they saw a ghost, stopped
short, as if contemplating a quick retreat; but Martin
ran forward, and, embracing me, gave way to the
most extravagant joy—hurrahing, dancing, and capering
about. Then suddenly, with his eyes filled with
tears, he said:</p>

<p>“Claud, Claud, old fellow, I never thought to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
you again alive. Oh! <i>how</i> terrible have been the
hours since we parted! You must have had a squeak
for it. But,” he added, “in the name of all that’s
gracious, what lucky chance has brought you to this
spot, and at the very nick of time, too?”</p>

<p>“A dollar,” I replied, for my mind was just then
dwelling gratefully upon that coin.</p>

<p>“A dollar!” he repeated, with a look that betokened
some notion that my adventure might have affected
my reason.</p>

<p>“Aye, a dollar!—or more correctly, perhaps, your
‘fool’s providence,’—<i>chance</i>.” And I related how it
had come to pass that I had chosen that direction.</p>

<p>By this time the natives, who had become convinced
that I was in reality something more substantial than
a ghost, with Kati at their head, flocked about to exhibit
their joy at my escape; and, after their national
custom, began to walk around and <i>smell</i> me, as is the
wont of cats at the sudden appearance of anything
strange in the household in which they are domesticated.</p>

<p>“If these fellows possessed tails,” said Martin,
laughing, “like cats, they would put them up at any
strange animal coming among them. But now, old
fellow, let us make for the village, or night will overtake
us, and on the way tell us the story of your
escape.” But just then Kati declared it to be his
opinion that I could not walk, and bent his body forward.</p>

<p>“Another pussy movement,” cried Martin; “Kati is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
really putting his back up at you;” but without replying
to this, I mounted pickback, and then, as Prabu
and my brother walked, one on either side, I related to
them my adventures, keeping for a more fitting opportunity
the name of To-ki, and all that had reference
to Marie’s abduction.</p>

<p>“By Jingo!” cried Martin, when I had concluded,
“you have had a narrow escape. But let us thank God
for His intervention—<i>He</i> alone has preserved you.”</p>

<p>To which my heart echoed, Amen; for deeply I felt
that the power alone of the Most High could have
brought me through that great peril. Then Martin
told me of the horror that had taken possession of
him when I had fallen into that chasm, and how that,
lighting the torch, he had endeavored to peer through
the darkness; that he had shouted down to me, hoping,
by an answer, to get proof that I had not been
killed, but hearing nothing but the echo of his own
voice, he endeavored to get back to Prabu as speedily
as possible; but, in consequence of losing his way,
he did not reach him till night, when, the torches having
been all used, they could not search for me. Then,
at daybreak that morning, my brother and his companions
had made every effort to discover the chasm
down which I had fallen, but they did not succeed
even in finding the passage to it. Many others had
they explored, but not that one; and at the time I had
so fortunately encountered them, worn out with fatigue
and dispirited, they were returning to the village,
to organize another searching party among those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
of the natives most experienced in the intricacies of
the caves.</p>

<p>“Terrible indeed must have been your feelings, dear
Martin!” said I, at the conclusion of his recital. “But,
surely, you must have given me up for lost; you never
expected to see me again!”</p>

<p>“Well, Claud;” but half choking with emotion—with
horror at the <i>might have been</i>, he brushed away
the tears from his eyes, exclaiming, “Hang it, old fellow,
it is all right now; we have you among us again,
so let us be jolly. But I say, Prabu,” he added,
“what think you of these nest-robbers? Can you
make any guess who and what they are?”</p>

<p>“Darkness is never long lasting, my young master.
What is written is written: the light is coming, and
the rogues will be known,” was the reply; and more
than that on the subject could not be got from him—at
least at that time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br>

<small>I RECOGNIZE THE NEST-ROBBERS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> warm was the welcome I received from our
host, the head-man of the village, and his daughter,
the “handsome one.” They met us at the door of
their house, and were both very curious to learn the
story of my escape, for neither had expected to see
me again in the flesh. Following them into the principal
reception-room, I intended to repeat to them the
substance of what I had told my brother and Prabu;
but guess my surprise at seeing, squatting upon the
floor, two of my unpleasant acquaintances, the cave-robbers;
and by Prabu’s countenance and manner, as
he introduced these men to me as “the strong one”
and “the weak one,” I saw that he fully comprehended
the meaning of my start and surprise.</p>

<p>These two worthies, I found, had heard from their
father and sister the story of my being lost, and were
earnest in their requests that I would tell them my
adventures; and I am afraid, I must confess, that I
found myself necessitated to fib myself out of the
difficulty: for I told them that the chasm was no great
depth after all, but that, falling head foremost, I had
been stunned, and that on coming to, I managed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
clamber up again, but then lost my way among the
intricate passages, where I had been ultimately discovered
by Prabu; who, by the way, did not evince
the least surprise, either by word or gesture, at a
story so different from that which I had told him, and
by which I now felt convinced he understood that the
cave-robbers and the men before us were identical.
But Martin looked the very picture of astonishment:
however—as an instant’s reflection upon the fact that
I had made no allusion whatever to the cave-robbers
told him that a strong reason existed for the discrepancy—he
said nothing.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of my story, I expected that
Prabu would, in some shape or other, have broached
the subject of nest-gathering; but he was too much
engaged, for he was talking soft nothings to the
“handsome one,” and reciting, in tones not much above
a whisper, the stock poem of all Javanese lovers—which,
by the way, is sufficiently curious, and in English
prose runs thus:—</p>

<p>“When my mistress looks forth from her window,
her eye sparkling like a star, its brilliant rays glancing
and glittering, her elder brother cannot support its
luster. Like the red mango is the hue of her cheek,
becoming her tapering neck, traversed with shadows
whenever she swallows. Her features like those of a
shadow or scenic figure; her forehead like the new
moon in its first day; her eyebrows curved so fair I
could devour her. Long has she been chosen to be
my mistress,—wearing a ring set with gems of Sailan,—her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
long nails shining like lightning transparent as
a string of pearls;—her waist slender and extremely
elegant,—her neck turned like a polished statue. Eloquent
in the enunciation of her words. Her parting
words like the crimson red wood; not by dress, but by
herself adorned. <i>Black</i> are her teeth stained with
<i>Baja</i> powder. Graceful, slender, appearing like a
queen. Her locks adorned with the <i>Saraja</i> flowers;
her features beautiful, with no defect of symmetry.
My soul is often fluttering, ready to depart; glancing
eagerly forth from my eyes, and quite unable to return
to its station.”</p>

<p>When, however, the young lady had retired, Prabu
entered into a conversation with his future brothers-in-law,
from which I found that, in addition to other
open-air occupations, they were gatherers of bees-nests,
for the purpose of collecting the wax, a commodity
much sought after by the Chinese merchants.</p>

<p>“My brothers have toiled long and hard these two
days; have they been fortunate?” Prabu asked.</p>

<p>“Our elder brother’s words are good,” replied the
“strong one;” “we <i>have</i> toiled long and hard, and
have been rewarded by lucky days.”</p>

<p>“Then my brothers have been fortunate, and their
house is filled with wax.”</p>

<p>“The worthy Prabu is right,” replied the “weak
one,” but wincing a little, I thoughts at the words,
“we have been fortunate.”</p>

<p>“Then, without doubt, my brother will sell me a
portion for the market at Singapore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Alas! that the worthy Prabu did not express such
a desire when last here, for it is impossible; it has
been gathered for the Chinese merchant Lin, whose
junk is even now in the western bay.”</p>

<p>“This is indeed unfortunate,” replied Prabu; “for
the prahu is large, and the bird’s-nests less plentiful
than we expected to find them.”</p>

<p>Then, evidently uneasy and desirous of changing
the subject, the “weak one” said:</p>

<p>“Our brother has not heard the good news—we
have discovered”—</p>

<p>“Another nest-cave!” interrupted Prabu, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not so, my brother; nothing so fortunate for his
highness the Pangeran; yet good, perhaps, for us and
thou, who art to be the husband of our sister.”</p>

<p>“In Allah’s name, then, what is this thing you have
discovered?”</p>

<p>“A mine of the metal <i>timah</i>” (tin), replied the
“strong one.”</p>

<p>“A mine of <i>timah</i>!” repeated Prabu in astonishment;
“God is great!—where?”</p>

<p>“Toward the setting sun, not three leagues from
hence,” replied the “strong one;” who then explained
that some few days before, while he and his brother
had been out bees-nest hunting, they had ignited a
large fire at the foot of a tree, and amongst the embers
afterwards found some melted metal, which upon
examination proved to be tin, and that, encouraged by
the discovery, they had commenced digging and were
rewarded by finding a vein of the ore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Truly it is a great discovery, and will enrich the
finders—nay, the whole province;” but, glancing at
Martin and me, he added, “Yet my brothers should
have been more wary in making known their fortune
before strangers, for should it come to the ears of our
Dutch masters, like voracious hogs they will seize the
treasure, even as they sought to do in the island of
Bangka.”</p>

<p>“It is not possible the young sahibs, our brother’s
friends, will betray this discovery, since it concerns
him as much as ourselves,” replied the “weak one;”
“but,” he added, “the sight will gladden the eyes of
our brother; therefore let him accompany us to-morrow,
and we will lead him to the spot.”</p>

<p>“My brother’s words are good—we need have no
fear of the young sahibs. They come from the land
of the Americans, and are too brave to rob their friend
when his back is turned,” replied Prabu, with a meaning
smile. “But,” he added, “the sleeping-mats await
us, the sun will be in the heavens before our eyes are
opened;” and the party at once sought their different
rooms: the villagers, as will be seen hereafter, to
scheme, Martin and I to sleep, and Prabu, perhaps, to
dream of the advantages to be derived from this new
discovery, which was to make the province as rich as
the island of Bangka—in fact, another Cornwall. But
a few words with my readers about tin and the tin
mines of the Indian islands.</p>

<p>So important was the finding of tin in the island
of Bangka regarded, that it has often been compared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
with the discovery of the great silver-mines of South
America. In 1710, the son of the King of Palembang,
sovereign also of Bangka, examining the <i>debris</i> of a
consumed village, found a quantity of melted metal,
which proved to be tin. Making this known to his
father, the king ordered his miners to dig well in the
ground, the result being the finding of a rich vein of
ore. The Dutch, hearing of this, at once sought permission
to establish a factory in the island; but the
king, either knowing too much about the rapacity of
the Hollanders, and being a man of larger mind than
most Asiatic sovereigns, or perhaps, and most probably,
consulting his own interests, refused his permission
to grant a monopoly, further declaring that <i>the
island should be free for all nations to trade in</i>. And
in less than thirty years from the discovery, so well
did the ignorant natives mine, that the island yielded
as much as Cornwall at the present time, and that, too,
by a process of mining simple, easy, and cheap.</p>

<p>But to comprehend that process, let us first examine
the geological formation of the island of Bangka.
Well, it is chiefly <i>primary</i> rock. The principal mountains
are of granite, and those of inferior elevation of
red ironstone. In the low tracts between these the
tin ore is found, and hitherto always in alluvial deposits,
seldom further than 25 feet from the surface.
The strata in which it is found are always in a horizontal
direction, and consist as follows:—First, or
uppermost, one-and-a-half feet of vegetable mould;
second, eight feet of black clay; third, six feet of gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
clay, intermixed with sand; fourth, six feet of black
clay; and fifth, or bottom-most, six feet of coarse
sand, of semi-transparent color, bedded in pure white
clay. Immediately beneath the last stratum occurs the
bed or <i>stream</i> of tin ore, disseminated in coarse fragments
of granite and other primitive rocks, and of
various degrees of depth.</p>

<p>As for the mine itself, it is nothing else than a large
oblong pit, made by excavating the ground, in a perpendicular
direction, to a depth of from 15 to 25 feet,
to remove the superincumbent strata of sand and clay,
and get at the ore. The first opening is seldom above
100 feet in length, and if the ore is discovered to lie
below the usual depth, the situation, in the present
abundance of mineral, will be neglected for a more
favorable one. The mines are divided into <i>large</i> and
<i>small</i>, called respectively, in the language of the country,
<i>kolong</i> and <i>kulit</i>. It is in the first only that the
process of mining is carried to any degree of refinement,
and that machinery is employed. The Chinese
alone are engaged in working these, and the average
number of hands employed in each mining operation
is from 25 to 30. The whole of the laborers work on
terms of equality, the older and more experienced directing,
and the younger and more active performing
the operative part, while all share equally in the profits.
Fortunately, it has been found impracticable to make
the Chinese labor on any other terms.</p>

<p>The whole process for obtaining the metal consists
of <i>mining</i>, <i>washing</i> and <i>fusing</i>; of each of these I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
shall supply a very brief sketch, in their natural order.
The situation for opening a new mine is determined
by some indications of the existence of the mineral,
well known to the experienced Chinese, and by the
usual test of <i>boring</i>. The ground being first cleared
of the huge primeval forest which covers all Bangka,
the miners begin methodically to remove the alluvial
strata to get at the ore. In large mines, of a superficies
of 100 feet by 80, this operation, conducted by
25 or 30 workmen, will occupy about from three to
four months. The earth is removed by little baskets,
a pair of which are suspended, according to the usual
custom of the East, from a beam or lever across the
shoulders of the workmen. The rough trunk of a
forest tree, felled upon the spot, and having steps cut
into it, constitutes the ladder by which the descent and
ascent into the mine is effected. The smaller mines,
besides being generally more superficial, are commonly
situated upon acclivities, and thus an accumulation of
water seldom incommodes the mining; but the larger
ones are more frequently in valleys, and soon filled
with water, which it is necessary to remove. This is
effected by a common and cheap hydraulic Chinese
machine. Sometimes a canal is made to pass close to
the mine, for the purpose of facilitating the labor of
removing the upper strata of sand and clay, which are
thrown into it as extracted, and thus carried off by
the stream. This is, of course, practicable only in
situations where the fluid has a considerable impetus.
The stratum of tin is pursued by a succession of pits,
following the first opening or shaft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>The <i>washing</i> of the mineral is performed in a manner
remarkably cheap and easy; the numerous mountain
streams, which characterize the physical aspect of
Bangka, in common with all the other considerable
islands of this tropical region, are the sources of this
facility. When there is much room for selection, it
becomes a material object to choose a mine in the neighborhood
of such mountain-stream, which is either
itself, or a canal from it, directed to the neighborhood
of the mine, where an aqueduct is regularly formed,
the sides of which are carefully lined with the bark of
the large forest trees of the neighborhood. Into this
trench the ore previously accumulated on its bank is
gradually thrown in, while a rapid stream of water
is made to pass through it, the laborer agitating the
materials with a hoe. The earth and sand are carried
off by the water. The ore and large stones by their
gravity subside, when the latter are separated from
the former by manual labor, with the occasional use of
sieves. The purified ore thus obtained is removed to
sheds erected for the purpose, and which contain the
furnaces and apparatus for <i>smelting</i>.</p>

<p>The process of smelting is usually performed once
a year, or, in a very productive season, twice. The
furnace is ten feet long, four wide, and composed of
clay. The bellows, or ventilator, is a piece of timber
about twenty-five inches in diameter, having a bore
of seventeen or eighteen inches, admitting a piston.
It is made of a single tree, and its fabrication requires
considerable skill. This engine, plied by three stout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
workmen, keeps up a constant blast on the furnace.
A quantity of ignited charcoal is first thrown into the
furnace, which continues, as long as the process of
smelting goes forward, to be fed alternately with ore
and coals. In due time, and when the furnace is
heated, the metal begins to flow, in a full stream, from
an aperture for the purpose in the bottom of the floor,
and is received into a basin, from which in time it is
removed, by a ladle, into moulds made of moist sand,
formed near the furnace. The size of these moulds
gives slabs or ingots of metal weighing 50 katis, or
66 2-3 lbs. This operation serves the double purpose
of smelting and roasting the ore. It is always conducted
in the night-time, to avoid the heats of the
day, which would be inconvenient in that climate to
the laborers. In the course of one night 5,280 lbs.
of ore are smelted, which, at an average, afford 44 or
45 ingots of metal, or 3,062 lbs.</p>

<p>The outlay of capital, according to this mode of extracting
tin, is trifling. Besides the waterwheel, ventilator,
and shed, including the furnaces, it consists of
the charges for pickaxes, spades, hoes, shovels, and a
few cheap wheelbarrows after a Chinese construction.
The very woods cut down on the site of the mines
afford the necessary charcoal for smelting. The whole
of the processes described are conducted by the Chinese.
The miners are scattered over the island, according
to the direction of the mines. Besides the
immediate laborers in the mines, many others are connected
with them, being engaged either in raising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
food and necessaries, or in fabricating the tools and
other materials required in the processes of mining,
washing, and smelting. Among these are blacksmiths,
carpenters, charcoal-burners, gardeners, etc. In the
present state of population, the corn consumed by the
workmen is more cheaply imported than grown. The
simplicity of the various processes of mining industry
is such, that little previous training is necessary. The
only exception to this is the business of the smelter,
which is always a separate trade. The miners are
almost all natives of China, and, notwithstanding the
difference of climate and the severity of their occupations,
enjoy good health.</p>

<p>Besides the tin extracted by the Chinese, by the intelligent
processes now described, an inconsiderable
quantity is obtained by the natives, by very rude
processes. The masters of the island, the Malays, or
at least the people of Palembang, imitate the Chinese
at an humble distance, and extract the ore by means
similar to those practiced by the latter in the <i>small</i>
mines. The aborigines follow still ruder processes:
they mine in the form of a narrow, cylindrical shaft,
capable of admitting one person only, and if the bed
of ore be found productive, follow it at the risk of
their lives under the alluvial strata, which often fall
in upon them. They have no waterwheel, no aqueduct;
to avoid the accumulation of water, they <i>must</i>
always mine on the acclivities of elevated tracts, and
for washing the mineral, it must be conveyed, as it is
extracted, to the nearest rivulet. In smelting, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
use small furnaces, and instead of the large and effectual
ventilator of the Chinese, the common Malay
bellows is employed by them. The metal is even transported
to the market with inferior skill; and to facilitate
its conveyance, is cast into much smaller slabs than
those of the Chinese, by which distinction it is known in
the markets. The different conditions of the three
races of men, in point of industry and civilization, is
distinctly portrayed in their respective manner of pursuing
the process of mining.</p>

<small>A SEARCH FOR A MARE’S-NEST.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I say</span>, Claud,” cried Martin, as soon as we were
alone.</p>

<p>“No, don’t—don’t say anything now; for I am
knocked up with fatigue and sore bones, and want
to tumble off to sleep at once.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but I <i>must</i>, old fellow. What a confounded
fib you told!”</p>

<p>“To whom?” I replied, reddening with indignation.</p>

<p>“Well, to the bee-hunters, or to Prabu and me; for
the two stories were about as much alike as black and
white.”</p>

<p>“Not to <i>you</i>, Martin. As for the chief’s sons, had
I told them the truth, depend upon it, I should have
had a creese in my side before the morning.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see,” he replied, thoughtfully. “It <i>is</i>, then,
as I imagined; they <i>are</i> the nest-robbers you saw in
the cave. I knew that a fellow who had never been
guilty of a falsehood in his life could not fabricate
such a tarradiddle without some great motive.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Martin; they are the selfsame men,
as you might easily have guessed from Prabu’s behavior.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Ah! but that is what I cannot understand. If he
<i>knew</i> them to be cave-robbers, why did he not accuse
them there and then?”</p>

<p>“Is he not the betrothed of their sister? But be
patient, Martin, and you will find that he has some
scheme in his mind for their confusion, if not punishment.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Claud, that can scarcely be; for did he not
jump at the opportunity of going with them to-morrow
in search of the tin ore?”</p>

<p>“That tin-ore story, Martin, is all fudge, and the
invitation is only to get Prabu away, while their companions
carry the birds’-nests they have collected from
the cave, perhaps down to the Chinese junk of which
you heard them speak; at least, that is my opinion,
and to-morrow will prove whether I am correct. But
now, old fellow, do let me go to sleep.” And go to
sleep I did, leaving Martin to work out what discoveries
he might during the night; and he made the best
use of his time, for scarcely had I opened my eyes in
the morning, than he said:</p>

<p>“Claud, you were right; those fellows, the bee-hunters,
are hatching mischief.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s your opinion now, is it, most sapient
Martin? Did I not say as much last night?”</p>

<p>“No, not my opinion: I <i>know</i> it.”</p>

<p>“<i>How?</i> What mean you?”</p>

<p>“Well, about the middle of the night, when it was
but natural to think everybody was asleep, that fellow
they call the ‘strong one’ went down to the seaside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and had speech with the captain of a Chinese junk
which is anchored nearly inshore.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” I exclaimed, with surprise; “but how know
you this? Did you dream it?”</p>

<p>“Dream it, bother, no! Couldn’t sleep—heard a
noise—got up—saw the fellow creeping along—followed
him at a respectful distance: you know the
rest; and now I have told you all. What do you
think of it?”</p>

<p>“Why, that my suspicions are confirmed. But we
must tell Prabu.”</p>

<p>“Then now is your time, for here he is,” said Martin,
as the captain entered the room, to ask us whether
we would go with Kati and the men to the cave, or
with him and the bee-hunters.</p>

<p>“Before we answer you, listen to what my brother
has to say,” said I; and Martin repeated what he had
just told me. For a moment he pondered, but then,
to our astonishment, laughingly said:</p>

<p>“It is nothing—it means nothing injurious to me.
Surely these men are my brothers, and may go to and
fro without their motives being questioned!”</p>

<p>“Prabu,” said Martin, wincing a little at this rebuke,
“you are a queer fellow; I can’t make you
out; you mean more than you say.”</p>

<p>“That is better than to say more than I mean; but
how choose my masters?”</p>

<p>“Let us go with Prabu, Claud,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” I replied; “for I believe I
have had enough of the caves, at least for some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
to come.” And so with Prabu and his two brothers-in-law
that were to be we set out, the latter being
laden with implements of their trade—namely, a
bundle of the husks of cocoanut-shells, a quantity of
small bamboo-sticks, and stout rattans.</p>

<p>Of course, the ostensible purpose of the journey
had been to examine the tin. Strangely enough, however,
after traversing hill, dale, and forest for some
ten miles, and a careful search in every direction, the
precious vein remained <i>non est</i>. The worthy brothers
had, they declared, carelessly forgotten to mark the
whereabouts. Now, to one who, like Prabu, had given
up a day’s profitable occupation in the caves, such a
disappointment should have been vexatious; but the
worthy captain did but smile and gently chide the
brothers, and beg of them to re-discover and well mark
the spot by the time he again visited the caves—adding,
philosophically, “Allah is great! What is written
is written: every day cannot be a fortunate one.”
Martin and I, however, felt much chagrined, for we
were convinced that the worthy brothers had, for some
purpose of their own, been hoaxing us.</p>

<p>“Verily,” said Martin to me, in confidence, “our
friend Prabu must be a little daft, or he would not
so good-humoredly take a day’s hunt for a ‘mare’s-nest’
for the profitable gathering in the caves.”</p>

<p>“Let us bide our time,” I replied, with more confidence
in Prabu, and feeling quite certain that some
kind of <i>ruse</i>, although unknown to us, was in preparation
to give the <i>honest</i> bee-hunters a <i>quid pro quo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Well, we had wasted the day in this fruitless search;
but as, toward evening, on our return, we entered a
dense jungle, the “strong one” called out that we were
near the bees’-nests. Upon hearing this, we all felt
enlivened; and our three companions began to cut
the branches of a palm, in which labor they were assisted
by Martin and me. Each having our arms full,
followed the “strong one” to the foot of a huge tree,
at which we laid our loads. The brothers then, throwing
upon the branches cocoa-husks, lighted their
torches; then, having repeated a Mahomedan prayer,
which concluded with “God, He is God, and Mahomed
is His Prophet!” kindled a fire; then, continuing
to wave their torches around them—partly to keep
off the bees when they should come down, and partly
in the belief that it would insure a good hive of
wax—awaited the rising of the smoke and flames in
sufficient quantities to arouse the insects. By the way,
Mr. Spenser St. John, at one time British Consul-General
in Borneo, thus describes the manner of taking
bees’-nests in that, the largest of the Indian islands:—</p>

<p>“The natives obtain beeswax from the nests built on
the tapang-tree, and climb the loftiest heights in search
of it upon small sticks, which they drive <i>as they advance</i>
up the noble stem, that rises above a hundred
feet free of branches, and whose girths vary from fifteen
to five-and-twenty feet. Once these pegs are
driven in, their outer ends are connected by a stout
rattan, which, with the tree, forms a kind of ladder.</p>

<p>“It requires cool and deliberate courage to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
a beehive at so great an elevation, where, in case of
being attacked by the bees, the almost naked man
would fall and be dashed to atoms. They depend
upon the flambeaux they carry up with them, as, when
the man disturbs the hive, the sparks falling from it
cause, it is said, the bees to fly down in chase of them,
instead of attacking their real enemy, who then takes
the hive and lowers it down by a rattan-string. The
bees escape unhurt. This plan does not appear to be
as safe as that pursued by the Pakatan Dyaks, who
kindle a large fire under it, and, throwing green
branches upon it, raise so stifling a smoke that
the bees rush forth, and the man, ascending, takes
their nest in safety. Both these operations are generally
conducted at night, although the second might be,
I imagine, practised in safety during the day.”</p>

<p>But to return to my narrative. As the dense smoke
now reached the hives, the little insects came forth
by thousands; and the two brothers, clambering up
the tree, dislodged the nest, finding in it, to their great
delight, a wealth of honey and wax, chiefly the latter—which,
by the way, constitutes a very valuable
and considerable article of commerce in
Java, from whence large quantities are annually
exported to China and Bengal. As for
honey, it is very scarce, and for the following reasons:
Bees are not domesticated in Java, nor, indeed,
with rare exceptions, in any part of Asia; the wandering
habits to which these insects are encouraged at all
seasons, by the perpetual succession of flowers, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
render domestication very difficult. It being, consequently,
unnecessary for them to lay up a store of provision
in a climate where there are flowers all the
year round, their honey is small in quantity; while,
from the quality of the vegetation, it is naturally of
much inferior flavor to that of higher latitudes.</p>

<p>Their success in taking this fine hive encouraged
them to continue the hunt; and after three more fires,
we returned to the village with as many hives, greatly
to the delight of the brothers “weak one” and “strong
one,” and, I may add, to that of Prabu; for, of the
four hives, he claimed and obtained two as his share,
a portion of which was awarded between Martin and
me.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the house of the head-man, we found
it almost impossible to obtain an entrance, in consequence
of a crowd of people, who were clamoring for
justice upon a poor old woman, whom they had
brought before the chief, and accused of killing a
man. Forcing our way into the large hall, where the
chief was holding his bed of justice, we heard the
case; and a very curious one it was, as illustrating the
superstitious habits of the people. It appeared that a
young man becoming suddenly mad, his friends had
taken him immediately to the old lady, who was the
acknowledged physician of the village. Well, Mrs.
Doctor, having prescribed several spells and incantations,
which proved useless, next recommended an
infallible cure. The patient’s head, in fact, was to be
placed over a pot of ignited sulphur until his senses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
returned. Accordingly, he was held in this position
by several of the stoutest men, who rendered all his
struggles to get away vain, until Mrs. Doctor considered
he had had a sufficient dose; but that, unfortunately,
was not until the great physician, Death,
stepped in; whereupon the friends, who had hitherto
possessed such faith in their female leech, at once
charged her with murder and took her before the chief;
who, after patiently hearing the case, very properly
exonerated the woman, but ordered her, under penalty
of death, never to try that particular prescription
again, since experience had proved it not to be one
of those legally admissible, inasmuch that it was certain
to kill or cure, but one that, sure as fate itself,
would <i>kill</i> and <i>not</i> cure; and thus ended the only <i>cause
célèbre</i> I ever saw tried in a Javanese village.</p>

<p>The old chief seemed that evening to be in an especially
good humor. He congratulated our party for
its success in bees’-nesting, and condoled with Prabu
upon his disappointment with respect to the tin-mine;
but the latter laughed it off, and even refused to be
consoled with one of the other two hives: nay, with
our permission as far as our share went, he presented
the old gentleman with his own two, as a compliment
to his betrothed, “the handsome one.” This generosity
the chief acknowledged by loading the table (<i>i. e.</i>,
floor) with all the dainties of a Javanese village, not
forgetting flagons of the strong rice-spirit. The latter,
however, Prabu scarcely touched; but withal we
spent a very jolly evening, and by their countenances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
I could see that the joviality of our hosts did not decrease
when, shortly after, Kati joined us. The captain
surprised us all by declaring that, as he had now
obtained his cargo of nests and the prahu was ready
for sea, he intended to sail at daybreak. On the contrary,
they became clamorous in their wishes for his
prosperity, and drank so deeply to his speedy return,
that Martin and I were not a little rejoiced when we
found ourselves once more alone and stretched upon
our sleeping-mats.</p>

<p>“There is something brewing,” said my brother.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is already brewed, and only awaiting
tapping,” said I. “But we shall see: ‘Sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof.’”</p>

<p>“Bother your musty old saws!” cried Martin.
“Can’t you tell me what you think of this sudden resolve
of Prabu’s to sail to-morrow? You know it is
all stuff about having his cargo ready and on board.
Why, he had but half a cargo yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Ah, brother mine! but perhaps some kind fairy,
by way of consoling him for his disappointment touching
the tin-mine, has supplied him with the other half.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Claud, it was no disappointment; you
know that he believed it all a hoax.”</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i> nothing, Martin; I can only guess and
hope.”</p>

<p>“But what do you guess and hope, then?”</p>

<p>“That would indeed be tellings, Martin. Why, it
would be giving you the end of a story before you had
got half through. No, it would spoil the whole; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
rest contented, or guess for yourself.” And then Martin
went to sleep in a very bad humor. In justice,
however, to myself, I was bound by Prabu not to tell
living soul either what I <i>knew</i> or <i>guessed</i> without his
permission.</p>

<small>WE BITE THE BITERS, BUT ARE OVERHAULED BY A DUTCH
CRUISER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> affectionate was the leave-taking between
Prabu and the chief’s family—nay, even Martin and
I shared in the kind words and presents of fruits and
rice-bread. It seemed, indeed, as if they had a difficulty
in finding words sufficient to express their joy
at our visit and their sorrow at our departure. Moreover,
they would see the last of us, and so they accompanied
us to the very edge of the water. Warmly
Prabu thanked them for their hospitality.</p>

<p>“It is good,” he said, as he stepped into the boat
that was to take us to the prahu, “that my friends
rejoice at our success this season in gathering nests;
but great indeed would be their rejoicing, if they but
knew its <i>real extent</i>.”</p>

<p>At this the “strong one” seemed to be a little uneasy,
as if his suspicions had become excited, and,
coming in advance of the others, he said:</p>

<p>“It may be long ere we meet again my brother,—perhaps
never—who knows? It will be a satisfaction,
then, if I take my last leave on board the prahu.” But
Prabu, gently putting him aside, stepped into the boat,
and, as the rowers were pushing her off, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Great, indeed, has been the kindness of my brothers
and father! Prabu’s gratitude shall be no less;
for as soon as his feet rest upon the deck of the prahu,
he will send them some presents, which will long keep
his name green in their memories.”</p>

<p>“Now, Prabu,” said Martin, “tell me <i>why</i> it is that
the prahu is half a mile from the shore, and riding at
single anchor only?” But the captain, whose eyes
were still fixed upon the party ashore, instead of replying,
burst forth into an extravagant fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“Surely our friend is a little mad!” said Martin,
queerly.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Martin; wait a while, and those fellows
ashore will become madder still.”</p>

<p>“Have you both lost your senses? Will you, or will
you not, tell me the meaning of all this?” cried my
brother, angrily.</p>

<p>“When we reach the prahu,” I replied.</p>

<p>Martin threw himself back in the boat in a sulky
fit. As soon, however, as we stepped on deck, he
cried:</p>

<p>“I see it all. By Jingo, what a clever trick!” and
then burst into a louder fit of laughter than Prabu.
And well he might: for there upon their knees, with
their hands tied and their long tails fastened together,
were six Chinese sailors; while Kati stood with a rattan-cane
in his hand, threatening to beat them if they
did not hold their tongues.</p>

<p>“Now, Kati,” said Prabu, “I have promised to send
those fellows ashore a present, by which they may
keep our visit fresh in their memories.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>This was sufficient: Kati knew what was to follow;
and coupled by their tails, twos and twos, the prisoners
were tossed into the sea, and they would have
swam well, but every now and then they stopped to
quarrel at the violent pulls they gave at each other’s
heads.</p>

<p>“A present of game—three brace of Chinamen,”
said Martin, laughing. “But, Claud,” he added, “it
was foul sailing not to tell me this scheme.”</p>

<p>“My dear Martin, my silence was at Prabu’s desire.
He believed it to be necessary for the success of
his scheme.”</p>

<p>“It was,” interposed Prabu; “but let the Sahib Martin
listen. When,” he continued, “the Sahib Claud
told us of the new cave and the nest-robbers, I determined
to make it known to the head-man, and ask
his aid in searching out the thieves; but when I saw
the sahib startle at the sight of my two brothers that
are to be, and heard him relate to them an account of
his adventures so different from that which he had
told us, I felt convinced that they were the robbers.
However, to be quite certain, at night—it was the
same that the Sahib Martin followed the ‘strong one’
to the seashore—I stole to the Sahib Claud’s bedside,
and found from him that my suspicions were correct.
I then, of course, guessed that the discovery of the
tin-mine was false, and the invitation to accompany
them the next day only given in order to get me out
of the way, while the Chinese captain and his men
could carry the nests from the cave to the ship. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
first impulse was to seize the rogues and send them to
the Pangeran for punishment; but, then, they were the
brothers of the ‘handsome one’ and I resolved only
to outwit them; but that I might do that effectually,
I desired the Sahib Claud not to divulge even to you
anything he knew or might know. Well, having accepted
the invitation to accompany the rogues in search
of the tin-mine, I left orders with Kati to hide with his
men in the jungle, near the shore where the junk was
anchored; so that when the Chinese came down with
the nests, they could seize and carry them on board
the prahu. How well he obeyed these orders you are
aware. I did not, however, know of his success until
he joined us last night; but learning it then, I at once
announced my intention of sailing this morning.”</p>

<p>“How jolly clever altogether!” exclaimed my
brother, admiringly.</p>

<p>“Look, Martin, I told you those fellows ashore
would soon be madder than me or Prabu,” I cried,
pointing landward; for the Chinese had by that time
swam ashore and told their tale, and the chief and his
sons were screaming, shouting, and flourishing their
creeses in the air. Prabu, taking the white linen from
round his head, waved adieu, which taunt so exasperated
the “strong one,” that he leaped into the sea
and begun to swim towards the vessel—a very great
piece of folly, by the way, at the rate we were running
before the wind, and which he was soon compelled to
relinquish.</p>

<p>“But, Prabu,” said my brother, seriously, “won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
you lose your sweetheart? For you know you will not
dare show your face among them again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” replied the captain, laughing. “My <i>dear</i>
brothers are so mad now that they would ‘run a
muck’ if they could get near us; but they will soon
cool down, and then they will remember that I have
shown them mercy; for they know that did I make
their roguery known to the Pangeran, his highness
would have the whole family uprooted from the village.
Remembering this, the next time I visit them
they will receive me with open arms, and laugh at the
superior cunning that outwitted them.”</p>

<p>“But have you not punished yourself, Prabu,” asked
Martin, “by quitting the coast with so small a cargo?”</p>

<p>“Not so,” he replied; “for the nests taken from the
rogues double in quality and quantity—at least, so says
Kati—any we could have gathered for the next moon.
Truly,” he concluded, “God is great! This cave is a
wonderful discovery!” and then he went to look after
the placing of his cargo; and, my brother and I being
alone, I took the opportunity of recurring to that portion
of my adventures in the cave which I knew would
so much interest him.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that Chinese fellow, Martin, we
tied up in the mosquito-curtains the night of the robbery
at Mynheer’s house?”</p>

<p>“Remember him, Claud! Is it possible I can ever
forget the rascal, or that night when poor Marie was
stolen from us? But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have seen and spoken to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“When—where—how?” he cried, seizing my arm.</p>

<p>I then related my adventure with To-ki; but instead
of expressing his joy at the news of Marie’s being still
alive, he complained that I had not discovered by
whom she had been stolen away.</p>

<p>“Claud—Claud!” he cried, “you have behaved unkindly,
cruelly, unbrotherly! You should have told
me all this the night before we went bee-hunting; and,
instead of accompanying those rogues, I would have
gone to the cave, and forced from the fellow at least
some clue to the person or persons who instigated the
kidnaping of our cousin.”</p>

<p>“It would have been useless, Martin, for the man
was a mere tool of the hunchback, and knew no more
than he told me; while you would have endangered
Prabu’s plans and our own safety. Patience, brother,
patience, and we will discover Marie yet.”</p>

<p>But words were useless; Martin considered himself
aggrieved, and was angry and almost surly with me
for a long time—at least, that day and the next—a
very long time for him.</p>

<p>One night, while running through the China Seas
for Singapore—at which place Prabu told us that he
should find a profitable market for his nests—as Martin
and I were alone on deck keeping watch, we were
startled by a most extraordinary noise. At first I took
it to be the beating of an Indian tom-tom in the distance;
but no—that was impossible, for we were far
from the land, and no canoe was near. Then it struck
me that it resembled the buzzing of a multitude of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
bees. Whatever it was, it caused a tremulous motion;
for, placing my hand upon the side of the prahu, I
could distinctly feel it.</p>

<p>“What can it be, Martin?” said I. “Are we grinding
over the top shoots of a coral forest, or is it a shoal
of sucking-fish mistaking the junk for a shark?”</p>

<p>“It sounds to me like the hissing of a myriad of
serpents,” replied my brother, and his surmise was not
unreasonable; for in those seas, yellow and black
snakes are very numerous, and it was possible we
might be cutting through a mass of floating spawn—but
then the water would have exhibited a phosphoric
sparkling. Thus, not knowing to what to ascribe it,
and fearing that it might be something dangerous to
the prahu’s bottom, I awoke Prabu, who was asleep in
the deck-cabin, and advised him to have the well
sounded; but he laughed heartily, and, much to our
chagrin, said the noise was caused by a shoal of “drumming-fish.”
These creatures, which are peculiar to
those seas, are of large size, very ugly, with a kind of
bladder under the throat; totally unfit for human food,
and capable of making themselves distinctly heard
while passing under the bottom of a vessel, even though
at a depth of seven fathoms. After this I pondered
some time before offering our captain advice—touching,
at least, the safety of the vessel.</p>

<p>The following day we met with an incident equally
ludicrous, although of a more vexatious if not mischievous
kind. About mid-day, while we were hiding
from the burning sun under deck-awnings, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
were startled by the report of a great gun, and, jumping
to our feet, saw a large ship bearing towards us.</p>

<p>“It is a Dutch war-sloop,” said Prabu.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Martin, “I can see that by her flag;
but that’s no reason why she should send that ball of
iron across our bows.”</p>

<p>“See,” replied Prabu, “her captain is signaling us
to hove to, while he sends an officer on board.”</p>

<p>“To what are we indebted for the honor of the
visit?” I asked, as soon as Prabu had given the order
to obey the Dutchman.</p>

<p>“He takes us for Chinese or Malay pirates. Like
the English, the Dutch will permit no thieves in the
East but themselves—at least, when they can prevent
it.”</p>

<p>The war-sloop’s boat was soon alongside, and in it a
dozen sailors, armed with cutlasses and pistols, and a
boy-officer, very short, very stout, and very consequential.</p>

<p>“Hilloa, you rogues!” said this stripling, as he
stepped upon deck, “where do you hail from, to what
port are you bound, and what have you on board?”</p>

<p>“From Java, and bound for Singapore, laden with
birds’-nests,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Laden with <i>what</i>?” asked the youngster, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Birds’-nests,” replied Prabu, touching his cap, or
rather the covering of his head; but the youngster—evidently
a fresh arrival in those seas, and who had
heard of no birds’-nests excepting those he had himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
taken in his school-days—flew into a violent passion.</p>

<p>“You impudent rogue, do you dare to make fun of
one of their high mightinesses’ officers?” he roared.
“Birds’-nests, indeed! I’ll birds’-nest the lot of you—a
precious greenhorn you must take me for!”</p>

<p>Now, I did not at all like the young man’s tone;
still, knowing he possessed the power to cause us much
annoyance, if he chose to use it, I went up to him, and
touching my cap, as bound by etiquette to a naval officer,
said:</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is true that we are only laden with
birds’-nests.”</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>you</i> are putting a spoke in, are you? Who,
pray, are you that speak Dutch, and are yet found
among these rascally pirates?”</p>

<p>At these insulting words, Martin, who had less respect
for their high mightinesses’ uniform than his
elder brother, cried:</p>

<p>“Stand by, Claud. Come, Mr. Midshipman, for all
that cocked hat and dirk of yours, you are exceeding
your duty. You were not sent here to insult honest
traders.”</p>

<p>“You impertinent rapscallion——”</p>

<p>“You queer little cockatoo, if you call me names I’ll
hit you,” said Martin, quite coolly, but beginning to
show fight; which so frightened me, that I caught his
arm, saying:</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, come away.”</p>

<p>“Bother!” replied Martin, releasing himself, “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
are not in the Dutch pay, and I don’t care a rap for
his cockatooship.”</p>

<p>“Here, Hans,” cried the enraged midshipman,
“tow that chap into the boat; the sloop’s short of powder-monkeys.”
But as the man so-called advanced
to obey the order, Martin darted past him, and struck
the officer a blow that made him reel. This caused
the latter to shout “Mutiny!” the sailors flourished
their cutlasses, and the prahu’s men, with their creeses
in their hands, prepared for a fight; but Martin, at once
brought to a sense of the folly he had committed, and
knowing the dangerous position he had placed us all
in, cried:</p>

<p>“Stand back, no fighting. Let them take me on
board the sloop, and if the captain is a gentleman, he
will soon release me.”</p>

<p>“The young sahib is right—they cannot detain him;
put up your creeses,” cried Prabu; then, addressing the
midshipman again, he said:</p>

<p>“Sahib, by Mahommed I swear, we are only birds’-nesters;”
but the middy, almost choking with rage,
replied:</p>

<p>“Silence, you rogue! Pretty big birds they must
be to require a couple of six-pounders to rob them
of their nests.” Then, turning to his men, he added—“I’ll
birds’-nest them. Off with the hatches, and
let us examine their cargo.”</p>

<p>Now, officer and men had expected that this order
would have caused a stout resistance on our side;
guess, therefore, their surprise when Prabu himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
led them into the hold, and, instead of the treasure
we were supposed to have as pirates, they saw nothing
but sacks of foul-smelling, muddy, and slimy
swallows’-nests. The men were dumfounded, and as
ignorant as their officer, for, perhaps, none of them
had ever been in these seas before.</p>

<p>“Rum! isn’t it, Hans?” said one of the sailors to a
messmate.</p>

<p>“I take it it’s ballast; but, anyhow, they must have
been hard up for shingle where they came from, to
put such sludge in her, and in bags, too!”</p>

<p>Observing the chagrin and disappointment of the
middy—who evidently could not make up his mind
what course to take, and, perhaps, felt more than half-ashamed
of himself—I endeavored to explain to him
the uses of the nests; but, alas for himself! he was
more unbelieving than ever.</p>

<p>“<i>Eat</i> these things!” he said, with disgust. “It is a
lie, youngster; pigs couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Aye, your honor,” interposed one of his men; “it’s
a yarn’d be unbelieved by the marines, and in my
opinion it’s a blind.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Hans, a blind it is, no doubt; still there
is no proof on board that they are pirates.” Then to
Prabu he said, “You are lucky this cruise, my fine fellow,
and we have lost our prize-money. We shall,
however, catch you yet;” and having, I suppose, become
tired of his visit, he left the prahu—politely,
however, intimating to us that, if we spread sail until
he had returned and made his report to the captain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
he would sink us. Accordingly, we waited, but the
boat-party had not long been on board again before a
signal was hoisted, telling us we might continue our
voyage; so I suppose the captain must have known
more about birds’-nesting and its commerce in the Indian
Archipelago than his young officer. And a pretty
quizzing the whole boat-party must have got from
their shipmates!—and as I thought of this, I regarded
the whole affair as a good joke, but not so Martin, who
more than once said:</p>

<p>“If ever I meet that little cockatoo in uniform
ashore, I’ll just pull his ears till they are as hot as
a couple of furnaces.”</p>

<p>By the way, a good story is told of a similar incident
that happened during the last war between England
and Spain—so good that I will repeat it. A certain
English captain, as ignorant of the nature and
value of the edible-nest as our midshipman, and who
was keeping an eager lookout for prizes in the Indian
seas, fell in with a Spanish ship. Boarding her,
they found her laden with the filthy-looking things,
which the Spanish commander affirmed to be <i>birds’-nests</i>.
The Englishman was at first indignant that a
trading captain should attempt to play off such a joke
upon him, and, believing that there was treasure of
some kind hidden beneath the bags, he caused a narrow
search to be made; yet, although nothing could be
found, he still believed the Spaniard to have been
playing a joke with him—in fact, to have been trying
the extent of his credulity. Thus, by way of turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the tables, he seized the ship, to sell her for the value
of her hull only. The rest of the story shall be given
in the words of its relater:—</p>

<p>“He then gave orders that a midshipman and three
or four of his worst men should take charge of her,
and run her into the nearest port. One rational thing
he did was to remove the Spanish prisoners to his own
brig, or they would have soon retaken her. Thus he
left her, and it was not until he himself had put into
a Chinese port, and accidentally mentioned the occurrence
as a joke against the Spaniards, that he learnt
the value of the prize.</p>

<p>“The edible birds’-nests were, at the time, selling
in the Chinese market at thirty-two Spanish dollars a
<i>kattie</i>, so that, on a computation of the quantity in the
vessel, she was worth from <i>four hundred thousand to
five hundred thousand dollars</i>; and he, poor fellow!—that
had served twenty years without clearing twenty
pounds prize-money—could have made a fortune. He
raged and stormed, and went to sea again to look
after her. He offered up prayers, for the first time in
his life, for her safe arrival in port. But it was decreed
otherwise: the few lubberly fellows he had put
on board were not sufficient to work her, and she was
wrecked on the coast of China.</p>

<p>“A galleon of gold-dust would not have been such
a windfall to the Chinese as was this cargo of nests.
The news spread like wildfire through the country, that
a vessel had stranded on their coast containing incalculable
wealth. The timid Celestials forgot their fears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
and, regardless of winds and seas, rushed through the
foaming surf—trampled the strong over the weak,
brother over brother—all hurrying on board the wreck,
which was so effectually pillaged that she was left
floating like an empty tea-chest, not a grain of cargo
being left sticking to her ribs. During the scramble
in the water and on the wreck—for every handful was
fought for—many lives were lost; and the coast for
several miles round was in anarchy and confusion, a
long time after.”</p>

<p>At length, after a six days’ run through the Straits
of Malacca—those straits so remarkable for their redundancy
of fish—so terrible to the natives of Singapore
from the fierce, savage tigers which are continually
swimming across from the peninsula—and at the
sight of Singapore, we were delighted: partly that we
should again be able to stretch our legs, but chiefly
that we should have some other food than fish, fish,
eternally fish, for we had long since run short of rice
and fruits. But the fish upon which we had been subsisting
for the last few days had filled me with disgust,
for to eat it gave one a notion of cannibalism;
and I will tell you why. It more resembled a human
being than a fish. It is the <i>dugong</i> (by some writers
supposed to have been the original of the mermaid),
of the order <i>Cestacea</i>, or <i>great beasts of the ocean</i>.
Its body is very bulky, tapering to a broad horizontal
tail. Instead of fins, it has two paws armed with
talons, and which, but for being webbed, would resemble
hands. Its head is almost of human shape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
and it suckles its young in an upright position, holding
it in one paw, while it supports itself in the water by
means of the other. The natives of the islands are
very fond of its flesh, which resembles young beef.
But, bah! the animal is so human-looking, and the females
have such a strong attachment to their young,
that when one of the latter is destroyed, the mother, it
is said, utters sharp, plaintive cries, sheds tears, and
easily permits herself to be taken. Now, are you surprised
at my disgust at being compelled to eat of its
flesh, more revolting even than that of young roasted
monkeys—a favorite dish upon the mainland? But we
have done with such food, for we are entering the
harbor of Singapore—that town which, under British
rule of forty years, has increased its population from
two hundred to thirty thousand.</p>

<p>It was day-dawn when we arrived; the sky was
just receiving its first bright tints from the rising sun,
and the morning mists yet hung about the marshes.
Nevertheless, early as it was, the harbor was alive
with boats, and resounding with the noisy hum of
awakened crowds. The long, low canoe of the Malay,
propelled by thirty paddles, each stroke accompanied
by their peculiar cry; sampans carrying ashore the
Chinese mariner, with his fan and umbrella; other
boats, with their clean matted seats and plantain-leaf
awnings, waiting for passengers, and promiscuously
manned by the Hindoo, the Moor, the Malay, the
Arab, or the wild natives of Borneo, Amboyna, Madura,
or Bali; the unwieldy junk with painted eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
which the Celestials believe guide them safely clear of
shoals and rocks—its large masts without rigging,
mast, sail; high-peaked stern, bedaubed with flying
dragons, painted devils, and proverbs, and the poop entirely
occupied by the indispensable Joss. Add to the
foregoing—boats laden with fruit of every description,
ready for the morning market; light fishing-canoes,
with their patient occupants, who will sit for
hours under the shade of their light grass hats; trading-vessels
of several European nations; a British
sloop-of-war;—and you have the scene presented to
us upon our first arrival at Singapore.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br>

<small>WE SELL OUR NESTS, ARE TAKEN PRISONERS, BUT OUTWIT
OUR CAPTORS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> could be no greater proof of the value of our
cargo than the extraordinary demand we found for it
at Singapore. The news of its arrival in the harbor
ran through the town like wildfire—at least among the
Chinese portion of the community—and the very next
day our little vessel was crowded with long-tailed
merchants, as eager to outbid each other as Jew brokers
at an auction-mart; and so courteous were these
men to our captain, that, although at other times they
would have treated him with contempt, the best of
them now approached him in the “attitude of respect,”
and with their <i>tails let down</i>. But let me explain the
meaning of the latter sentence.</p>

<p>Chinese “men of business,” for greater convenience,
twist their long tails round the tops of their heads;
but to omit to drop them to their full length in the
presence of a superior, or, what to them is more, one
from whom they expect to obtain a favor, is deemed
in China as great a mark of ill-breeding as it would
be in America for a person to enter a room with his
hat on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Thus, as you may imagine, from this demand Prabu
realized a very large sum for his nests. Nevertheless,
the whole cargo was sold to one man. But now
commenced the most unpleasant part of our work, for
we had to sort them into three different qualities, and
pack them in boxes. This labor lasted about three
weeks; and then, at least for a time, we were free
to roam the island until we had taken another cargo
of something—we knew not what—on board. But a
few parting words about these nests.</p>

<p>From the fact of the nests being worth more than
their weight in silver, it is evident that they are only
articles of expensive luxury. They are consumed
chiefly by people of rank, the greater part being sent
for the consumption of the Court at Pekin. The sensual
mandarins use them, in the belief that they are
powerfully stimulating and tonic; but it is most likely,
that their most valuable quality is their being, like
porridge, neither good nor harm. The Japanese, who
resemble the Chinese in many of their habits, have no
taste for the edible-nest; and how the latter acquired
a taste for this foreign commodity, is only less singular
than their persevering in it. Among the Western
nations there is nothing equal to it, unless we except
the whimsical estimation in which the Romans held
some articles of luxury, remarkable for their scarcity
rather than for any qualities ascribed to them.</p>

<p>Now, for some reason or other (I suppose the large
sum he had obtained by the sale of his cargo), Prabu
promised extra pay and allowances to his crew, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
presented my brother and me with a couple of capital
American rifles—a fit of generosity that put all on
board in good spirits. But, alas! suddenly a deep
gloom was cast over us by two accidents, which happened
within a couple of days of each other.</p>

<p>One of the men having been sent with a message
to a merchant, whose warehouse was situated some
two or three miles along the coast, and with whom
Prabu was negotiating for a return cargo, his boat
was attacked by an alligator, who capsized it with his
tail, seized its inmate, and carried him away to a hole
in the bank, there to remain for some <i>future</i> meal;
for the alligator never devours his food, whether it
be man or beast, until it has been kept for some days.
Another poor fellow had been sent upon a similar errand,
but upon his return was seized and carried into
the jungle by a tiger.</p>

<p>As, however, it may appear marvelous to my reader
that <i>two</i> such tragic events should have followed so
closely upon each other, let me explain that every inlet
near Singapore abounds with alligators, and every
jungle with tigers. As for the latter, it seems impossible
to exterminate them; for although the Government
gives a reward of fifty dollars, to which the merchants
of the town add a like sum, for a dead tiger,
and, moreover, the slayer can get a good price for its
beautiful skin, and another for the flesh, which is
bought by the Chinese for food, the annual deaths by
these beasts reach the number of forty. Nor does
there seem much hope of extirpating them; for, faster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
than they can be killed, others swim across the Straits
of Malacca from the mainland to the island. I may
here mention, as a curious fact, that the tiger was unknown
in Singapore until after its occupation by the
British under Sir Stamford Raffles, in 1819, and one
from which a Buddhist, who believes in the transmigration
of souls, might infer the savage brutes to be
the re-embodied souls of former proprietors of the
soil, seeking vengeance upon the descendants of their
dispossessors.</p>

<p>Now, as our crew, like all the half-savage natives
of the Indian islands, regarded the ferocious brutes
of the forests as ruthless enemies, who should be made
responsible for their deeds, rather than as creatures
who merely obeyed the instincts of their natures, they
beseeched, nay, on their knees, implored of the captain
permission to revenge the deaths of their shipmates;
but Prabu, superior in intelligence to the majority
of his race, believing that the search for a particular
alligator or tiger, in a country which abounded
in both, would be something like looking for a needle
in a haystack, or not caring to risk the loss of live men
for the sake of revenging dead ones—kindly but firmly
refused; and then, so great was his influence over
the minds of these wild fellows, that, his decision once
given, there was not a murmur afterwards. But, then,
he had a capital recipe for the cure of grief—one I
advise my young readers to try if ever they have a fit
of the “<i>doldrums</i>”. It is the poor man’s best cure
for sorrow—<i>work</i>, hard work. He employed them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
first, in putting the vessel all taut, cleansing, repairing,
and then in loading her with a fresh cargo, which consisted
of casks and oblong cases of great size, filled (so
Prabu told Martin and I, who were curious enough to
ask the question) with silks, crapes, silver, gamboge,
and other products of the Celestial Empire.</p>

<p>To us boys, however, there appeared some mystery
about our new cargo; for Prabu not only hesitated before
he answered the question, but replied very surlily,
as if vexed at being questioned. Then, again, we
thought it strange that it had been packed, ready for
shipment, long before our arrival in Singapore; but
another incident happened, that added to our curiosity.
Prabu had ordered the prahu to be got ready for sailing
upon a certain Saturday; but upon the Wednesday
previously, after spending some hours in the town,
as he and I were taking our seats in the boat to return
to the vessel, he was hailed by a Dutch naval officer,
just then coming ashore. Evidently annoyed, he
said in a whisper—</p>

<p>“Sahib, it is the captain of the Dutch cruiser, which
put into the harbor yesterday.”</p>

<p>At once he got out of the boat and held a long conversation
with the officer, but at such a distance that
I could not gather a word. Now, this incident was
not much in itself, but then, the moment he returned
to the prahu, he gave orders for the ship to be put in
such a shape that she could sail with the first wind;
and, as a favorable breeze blew up that night, the anchors
were lifted as gently as if the men had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
afraid of awakening the fishes, and we slipped from
the harbor stealthily—as if, in fact, the prahu’s character
was no better than it ought to have been.</p>

<p>“It’s queer work, this,” said Martin to me; “one
would almost think Prabu hasn’t paid for the cargo,
and was slipping away from his creditors.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I; “Prabu is neither pirate nor swindler.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, <i>what</i> is it?”</p>

<p>“My opinion is——”</p>

<p>“What?” Martin interposed, eagerly.</p>

<p>“That—that—well, to speak plainly, I don’t know,
except that it does not matter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does it not, though, if we are run after and
taken by that Dutchman you were telling me about!
It is <i>my</i> opinion, Master Claud, that we who are
sailing in the boat should know all that is going on in
her.”</p>

<p>“Then look you, Martin, you must ask Prabu what
he has in those casks and cases; for if there be any
mischief brewing, the cause lies there.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “<i>who’s</i> afraid? He can’t eat me,
I suppose;” and the first time we caught Prabu alone,
he put the question; but Prabu answered, as before,
“China produce,” and walked surlily away.</p>

<p>“There, Martin,” said I, laughing, “people who don’t
ask questions don’t hear stories.”</p>

<p>“You may laugh, Claud,” he replied, angrily; “but
it is no laughing matter. Depend upon it, mischief
of some kind is brewing.”</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding my brother’s fears, no harm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
threatened for some weeks. When, however, we were
in the China Sea, we fell in with a typhoon, which so
knocked us about, that we were compelled to put into
a port of Sumatra, in the Straits of Bangka, for repairs;
and this delay very nearly cost us dearly, for it
was three weeks before we could get under weigh
again.</p>

<p>Well, we had reached within a few days’ sail of the
Straits of Sunda, when, one morning about day-dawn,
as the heavy mists were just clearing away, we espied
a ship in our wake; and about the same time she must
have descried us, for she sent up a signal for us to
stand to, as she was about to send an officer on board.
The only answer made by Kati, who was the chief officer
upon deck, was to order the crew to shot the guns
and crowd sail; but Prabu, coming up, at once countermanded
the order. At that moment, a heavy ball
whistled through the air over our heads.</p>

<p>“By jingo! the Dutchman means business,” cried
Martin, bobbing down his head after the ball had
passed.</p>

<p>Kati looked ferocious, and laid his hand upon his
creese; but Prabu, quite coolly, said, “Nay, Kati, as
becomes a man of Bali, thou art brave; but it is useless
now, for our heads are not of stone or rock, that
they can resist such missiles; neither, thanks to the
typhoon which crippled us, and to the mists which
have kept us out of sight of each other, can we outrun
her—so let us receive this officer on board as if we
loved him. No, it will not do to fight—we must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
show our teeth to our friends;” and then he gave the
lieutenant some order in a whisper, and disappeared
below.</p>

<p>“That’s the identical Dutchman who hailed Prabu,
as we were stepping into the sampan at Singapore,”
said I to Martin, as an officer and a dozen armed sailors
came alongside in a boat.</p>

<p>“Then keep a sharp lookout, for now the mischief’s
brewed,” replied Martin.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> have you on board, from whence do you
hail, and to what port are you bound?” asked the
Dutch officer, as soon as he stood on deck.</p>

<p>“As the captain is aware (for he asked the same
questions at Singapore), we have taken a cargo of
nests to Singapore, and are now bound for Batavia
with Chinese products,” replied Prabu.</p>

<p>“What products?”</p>

<p>“Silks, silver, and provisions, Sahib Captain.”</p>

<p>“Who are your owners?”</p>

<p>“The Chinese merchant Sing, of the Campong.”</p>

<p>At this reply Martin and I opened our eyes, for we
knew it to be a falsehood.</p>

<p>“But have you arms on board?”</p>

<p>“Sahib, <i>no</i>—at least not as cargo.”</p>

<p>“Dog!” replied the captain, sternly, “these answers
are false. This prahu belongs to the Pangeran of
Pugar, to whom you are carrying arms.” At the latter
name Martin touched my shoulder. It was that
of the native prince who was upon such intimate terms
with Ebberfeld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>As for Prabu, at the epithet “dog,” his eyes flashed,
and he had a nervous twitching about the fingers, as
if he longed to handle his creese; but, taking a bundle
of papers from his sarong, and presenting them to
the officer, he said, in a very humble tone—</p>

<p>“The Captain Sahib is pleased to doubt the truth
of his servant; let him peruse these.”</p>

<p>Having examined the documents, the officer returned
them to Prabu.</p>

<p>“These papers <i>are</i> correct,” said he; “I have been
misinformed;” and he would have left the vessel, quite
satisfied, but for one of his men, who whispered in his
ear; when, turning again to Prabu, and pointing to
some casks on deck, he asked if they contained provisions.</p>

<p>“Sahib, if I have not been deceived, they do,” replied
Prabu, bowing, but with hesitation.</p>

<p>“Good,” replied the Dutchman, sharply; “then I
will buy a cask or two, for we are running short.”</p>

<p>“Sahib, it is not possible—they are consigned to
the owner of the prahu,” cried he, with alarm; but it
was useless. At a signal from their captain, the busy
sailors stove in the heads of two of the casks.</p>

<p>“Hillo!” cried the captain; “they must have strong
stomachs who can digest such provisions!”</p>

<p>Astonished at the words, my brother and I advanced
to look at the contents, when, lo! we beheld one filled
with gunpowder, the other with small arms, such as
bayonets, sabers, and pistols; and I must confess that
I trembled as it occurred to me that my brother and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
had been inveigled into some conspiracy, perhaps,
without our knowledge.</p>

<p>At the sight of the weapons, the Dutch sailors placed
their hands upon their pistols and cutlasses, as if they
expected a sudden attack from the crew; but no—the
latter remained quite passive. As for Prabu, he
affected no little astonishment at the contents of the
casks.</p>

<p>“God is great!” he exclaimed. “Truly the Singapore
merchant must have sent on board the wrong
cargo, for these are not named in the bills;” and so
genuine seemed his surprise, that the captain, I believe,
thought him the dupe or unwilling agent of
others; but, unfortunately, my brother, thinking to
put in a good word or two, came forward, and, in
very good Dutch, said—</p>

<p>“Our captain is as much astonished as yourself, sir;
he has been duped, either by the Chinese merchant of
Singapore, or he of the Campong.”</p>

<p>“<i>Who</i> are you, my young cocksparrow, to be found
chirping away in good Dutch among these piratical islanders?”
asked the captain, in surprise—so much were
we browned by the sun and sea-air, and so greatly did
our attire, or rather want of attire, resemble our shipmates’,
that without a very close examination, or hearing
our voices, he could never have guessed us to be
Americans.</p>

<p>“Cocksparrow, sir!” replied Martin, very indignantly—“not
so much a cocksparrow as you are an hungry
vulture, prowling the seas to rob honest men of
their cargo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Come, come, my little fellow,” (Martin stood nearly
five feet ten in height, although he looked very
young in the face), “chirp out your name, and the
whereabouts of your nest, that I may send you to your
mother.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, now interfering, hoping in my wisdom
to put matters straight; “he is my brother, and a
gentleman, although you see us both here with honest
Prabu; we are the nephews of the rich Madam Ebberfeld,
of Batavia.” <i>That</i>, thought I, will convince him,
at least, that we are respectable; but to my astonishment,
he said—</p>

<p>“Nephews of Ebberfeld, <i>are</i> you? It is then as I
thought.” Then turning to his men, he added, “Clap
these fellows under hatches; they are rebels and
traitors, carrying arms to the Pangeran.”</p>

<p>At this I certainly thought Prabu would have offered
resistance, but not so: mildly and meekly, as a
lamb going to the slaughter, he not only permitted himself
to be put in irons, but commanded his men to submit
likewise. Thus, with the exception of two (who
were left to help in working the vessel), and Martin
and I, they were led below. This being done, the
captain returned to his boat, promising the sailors that
he would, on his return to the ship, send an officer on
board.</p>

<p>“A pretty termination to our nest-hunting expedition,
Claud!” said Martin, as, about an hour afterwards,
we stood watching the approach of another
boat bringing the officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Yes—to be taken back to Batavia as traitors and
rebels to the Dutch Government! Oh! how foolish I
was to mention our connection with Ebberfeld!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” replied my brother; “but never mind, old
fellow—cheer up, something may turn up yet to rescue
us;” but just at that moment the boat grated
against the side of the prahu, and a Dutch sailor, striking
us with a rattan-cane, told us to salute the officer.</p>

<p>“Salute that fellow—by jingo, no! Why, it is little
cockatoo,” cried Martin, as he recognized the same
midshipman who had overhauled our birds’-nests.</p>

<p>“Hush, Martin! remember we are in his power
now,” said I; but the warning was useless—the consequential
little fellow had overheard the words.</p>

<p>“Give that young pirate a couple of dozen with your
rattan, Hans,” said he; “it will teach him manners.”</p>

<p>But, in an instant, Martin had caught up a handspike.
“The first,” he cried, “who attempts to lay
hands upon me shall have this in his breast.”</p>

<p>But open resistance was useless—worse, for it caused
our petty tyrant not only to add to the number of
blows, but to have my poor brother taken below and
clapped in irons, to all of which I made no objection;
for I knew that, while at liberty, I should have at least
some chance of assisting him. I patiently bided my
time, and an opportunity soon came.</p>

<p>Some hours after the midshipman had arrived on
board, and we had passed out of sight of the war-sloop,
the Dutch sailors reported to their officer that
there was neither meat nor poultry—indeed, nought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
but rice—on board; whereupon the little worthy had
Martin brought before him.</p>

<p>“Now, young devilskin,” he began.</p>

<p>“Now, young cockatoo,” answered Martin, impudently,
and foolishly, too, for it brought him a couple
of stiff blows of the rattan.</p>

<p>“Where are the provisions stowed away?”</p>

<p>“Where a lubber like you can’t get at them,” replied
my brother, more defiantly than ever; adding, as the
sailor gave him another heavy blow with the rattan,
“Go on, my good fellow; you and this little cockatoo
shall have it all back with good interest, for I know
you dare not kill me.”</p>

<p>“You impudent vagabond!” cried the enraged little
officer, “I will have you flogged within an inch of
your life.”</p>

<p>“All right, you little coward; that wish will be quite
enough to enable me to impress upon your hide a
souvenir that you won’t get rid of for the rest of your
life.”</p>

<p>“Will you, or will you not, tell me where the provisions
are stowed away?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied my brother, very coolly, “I will, because
it will make you squeak yourself into a fit, my
small friend. The provisions,” he added, “with the
exception of rice and water, were all thrown overboard
when your rogue of a captain first came on board.”</p>

<p>“Rascal!” again squeaked the middy, “by whose
orders was it done—what for? Tell me the truth, or
I will have you starved to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Oh, never fear! I will tell you the truth,” he replied.
“Well, the provisions were sunk that you Dutch
rats might be starved out of the ship; and now you
know all, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>The effect of this reply upon the midshipman was
comical in the extreme. He first ordered the sailor
to take Martin below; then he walked about the deck,
giving vent both to rage and fear—the first, that good
provisions should have been thrown away—the latter,
that he would have to live the rest of the voyage upon
rice and water, which, to a high-feeding Dutchman,
was something like starvation.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! oh, dear!” he cried like a child, “what
shall I do? Oh! why did I ever leave Amsterdam?
The captain should have left provisions on board; I
will make my complaint to the Governor-General at
Batavia.”</p>

<p>Now, while he was thus soliloquizing, I was standing—watching,
listening, and laughing—behind a sail;
but, seeing something in the distant horizon which
looked like a ship, an idea that might result in advantage
to myself occurred to me; so, stepping
forward, and touching my cap in mock respect, I said:</p>

<p>“A ship in sight, sir; her captain will, perhaps, spare
you some of his provisions.”</p>

<p>“A ship in sight! Dear me, that’s good news, for
we may get some pork,” he replied; then, having swept
the horizon with his glass, he said:</p>

<p>“It is a Chinese junk, and she flies the Dutch flag;
she must, therefore, thank God, be in the Governor-General’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> 
service: moreover, she seems at anchor
among yonder islands.”</p>

<p>Thus, the prospect of a leg of pork being nearer, assuming
his usual consequential air, he said—yes, that
little whipper-snapper, who did not stand above five
feet three in his shoes, said to <i>me</i>, who stood nearly
six feet without shoes:</p>

<p>“Now, you <i>boy</i>, do you think I could trust you?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” replied I, touching my cap, and with
great difficulty suppressing a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he replied, “I believe I can, for you
are not like that <i>other</i> rascal—you have a civil tongue
in your head. But do you know what a pig is?”</p>

<p>“I believe I should know one if I saw it, without
it was like the wolf in sheep’s clothing.”</p>

<p>“You rascal, are you laughing at me?”—and he
shook his fist in my face.</p>

<p>“No, sir; shouldn’t dare to laugh at an officer in
command,” I replied, as seriously as possible; and this
mollified him, for he replied:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think you would, at least not at me—it
wouldn’t be safe. But can you tell a good pig from
a bad one?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, look you, boy; I can’t spare any of my
fellows, so at sundown, by which time the Chinaman
will be near us, take the boat and a couple of your
piratical companions, and ask the Chinese fellow for a
couple of his pigs.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir; but am I to steal them, or pay for
them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“Why, you rogue, do you take me for a pirate? No;
I will write you a requisition, which will be sufficient
for the Chinese skipper; for if he shows it to the authorities
at Batavia, he will be paid.”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, remembering the size of the prahu’s
boats, “there is no boat that will hold them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk, boy; orders are orders, and must be
obeyed,” replied the pompous little chief. “If they
won’t fit, they must be made to fit.”</p>

<p>“The boat the pigs, or the pigs the boat?”</p>

<p>But all the answer he made was: “Go away, and be
ready at sundown; but remember, if you attempt any
tricks, or do not return to the prahu within three
hours, I will hang up that rascal brother of yours.”</p>

<p>Well, at sundown he gave me the requisition, and,
with my two men, I put off for the Chinaman. It
was a terrible pull, for the boat was a small sampan.
The artful little middy insisted upon our taking that,
thinking that if, in defiance of his threats, we were to
attempt to get further out to sea, it would be impossible.
And indeed it would, for we had no rudder,
and but a couple of wretched little paddles; and as the
current among the islands runs all manner of ways, as
if in opposition to each other, it was as much as we
could do to keep her head straight. Nay, more than
once, when one of the men took his paddle out of the
water, the wretched little craft spun round like a teetotum.
Well, by dint of great exertions—keeping
pretty straight, perhaps, for a quarter of a mile, and
then being brought to a dead halt, and sent round like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
an horizontal catherine-wheel, every instant expecting
she would swoop down head foremost—we came
alongside the junk, just as they were hanging out their
night-lanterns. A pretty prospect, I thought, the return
performance would be, with the addition of a
couple of swine—nay, without they were sucking-pigs,
the sampan would not hold them; so sucking-pigs I determined
they should be, if I could manage it.</p>

<p>But then came another difficulty. I had no knowledge
of the Chinese language. However, I knew that
the Celestials at Batavia spoke what was called “pigeon
Dutch”—the most extraordinary language, perhaps,
ever invented. And so, calling to the men on board, I
said: “One fine Dutch man wantee get top side”—which,
translated, meant, “a Dutchman wanted to get
upon deck;”—but, to my great relief, a man answered
in pretty good Dutch, that I might come on board. So
on board I went, and, telling the people on deck what
I required, was at once shown into the captain or master’s
cabin—if, indeed, one can dignify with such a
name a mere awning supported by four bamboo poles.
However, from the center there were suspended a
couple of lanterns, beneath which, after the fatigues of
the day, reclined a Chinese, but—to my horror—the
very captain who had been leagued with Prabu’s intended
brothers-in-law, and whom we had first deprived
of his cargo and then tossed into the sea. I had
but one hope—he might not recognize me, but that
soon vanished when I saw him put down his opium-pipe;
for, fixing his eyes upon me, as might a panther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
about to spring upon its prey, he arose, and, clutching
me by the arm, said:</p>

<p>“Rat, and son of a rat! is it possible that the rogue
and thief Prabu can have sent for provisions to the
man he despoiled and insulted? By the bones of my
ancestors, in place of two pigs’-heads I will send him
back the head of a goose!—for who but a goose would
have dared to come to <i>me</i> from <i>him</i>?” And then, by
way of illustrating his intention, he passed the back
of his naked sword across my throat.</p>

<p>I had, indeed, rowed out of the frying-pan into the
fire. What should I do? What <i>could</i> I do to save my
life, and, worse, that of my brother?—for had not
that little wretch threatened to hang him if I did not
return in a given time? Suddenly, it occurred to me
that flying the Dutch flag, one in that service would be
held free from harm, if only from fear of the authorities
at Batavia. Then I told him that I had not been
sent by Prabu—in fact, the whole story of the discovery
of the arms and the confinement under hatches of
Prabu and his crew; but at this his conduct was very
extraordinary—he raved as if he had been mad, not at
Prabu, but at the Dutchman. Then, reviling all Hollanders,
and that one especially who had boarded our
prahu, he invoked the name of Prabu as that of a good
man—a brave man—and called down curses upon his
own head for having reviled him. But at length, becoming
cool, he inquired the number of the Hollanders
who had possession of the prahu. When I informed
him, and also given a description of the officer in command,
he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“My brother is young, but he is brave. Would he
dare to strike a blow for the rescue of his friends?”</p>

<p>“If the worthy captain be sincere,” said I, “in his
desire to befriend Prabu and his men, let him give me
the opportunity, and he shall see.”</p>

<p>“It shall be as my brother wishes! May the day be
fortunate!” he replied. Then, calling his first mate,
he related to him the story of the Dutch officer’s discovery
of the arms; and the lieutenant went almost as
mad as had his captain a short time before—only,
more practical than his chief, he proposed at once to
man the boats and send them to the rescue.</p>

<p>It was then arranged between us that a pig should
be put into my boat, with creeses and pistols for myself
and the two men; and that another, filled with
armed sailors, should follow close in our wake with
muffled oars. The night was moonless, and so dark
that it was not probable the latter party would be seen;
but to be prepared for a contingency, a pig was to be
put into their boat also, which would be sufficient excuse
for its appearance in company with mine.</p>

<p>Well, in about an hour we started—I being not a
little proud at having the command of an expedition
for the rescue of my brother and friends; and we
reached the prahu without any accident, excepting that
piggy having burst his bonds, I had considerable difficulty
in holding him quiet in the boat.</p>

<p>Having directed my two men to hide under the
raised stern until they heard the report of a pistol, I
hailed the people upon deck. The little midshipman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
being very hungry and anxious for his pork, was the
first to answer by commanding me to bring the pig on
board.</p>

<p>“It is a Chinese pig, and as big as a rhinoceros,”
said I. “We want help—throw out a rope.”</p>

<p>Having secured this rope, not only round the animal,
but also round the sampan, so that the great weight
would afford an excuse for the aid of several men, I
left one in the boat, and with the other went upon
deck.</p>

<p>“The animal is large and heavy, sir,” said I to the
officer—“it will require at least three people to man
the rope;” and the greedy little middy was so delighted
at having secured so fine a pig, that he ordered four
of his Dutch sailors to my assistance.</p>

<p>Well, away they went to work—tug, tug! Of
course, there never was so heavy a pig. Then suddenly,
as I had arranged with the man below, the rope
snapped in two, and the men upon deck fell backwards.
I fired my pistol, and closed with one; the
man who had ascended with me took another, and he
in the boat was up the side like a wildcat upon a third;
and before they had time to recover from their surprise,
the Chinese, springing from the other boat into
the prahu, came to our assistance, and I believe not
one life would have been saved—for the Chinese, with
their four thousand years of civilization, are by far more
bloodthirsty and cruel than the wild islanders of the
Archipelago—had I not begged hard of them to stay
their hands, at least till our friends should be released,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and so be enabled to share in the vengeance upon the
Dutchmen. So, leaving the prisoners in charge of the
Celestials, I and my two men unfastened the hatches.</p>

<p>“God is great!” was the only expression of Prabu
at his unexpected release.</p>

<p>“Claud, old fellow, how did all this come about?”
said my brother.</p>

<p>“Not a word—not a word!” I answered, “until we
have rescued the throats of the Dutchmen from our
Celestial friends.”</p>

<p>“The sahib is right—not a drop of blood must be
shed,” replied Prabu. Nor was another word spoken
until we had taken our late masters from their dangerous
position, and placed them under hatches.</p>

<p>But what had become of our late redoubtable commander?
The length and breadth of the deck, the rigging
was searched, but he was not to be found—at
least until Martin, seeing the top of the brine-tub
move, exclaimed, “I smell a rat!” Then, lifting the
lid, all but the imperturbable Prabu became convulsed
with laughter; for, crouching down, buried up to the
shoulders in brine, with pale face and chattering teeth,
was the officer of the Dutch navy.</p>

<p>“Why, our little cockatoo is trying to preserve himself
by pickling!” cried Martin: then, looking very
ferocious, he added, “But he is not scalded yet—bring
hither the hog-tub and boiling water.”</p>

<p>“Oh! pray, good young gentlemen,” cried the little
fellow, in great terror, “do not put me to so horrible
a death; hang, shoot me, or anything else!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“You wretched coward, come out, or you will die
of fright, and rob us of the satisfaction of killing you,”
cried Martin, helping him out of the tub.</p>

<p>Having thus recaptured the prahu, it became a difficulty
to know what to do with our prisoners. Our
Chinese allies very coolly proposed cutting off their
heads, “for,” said they, “men without heads can’t
make mischief.” When, however, these gentle advisers
had quitted us, we put them ashore upon one of
the islands, leaving with them a supply of pork, rice,
and water.</p>

<p>Having thus got rid of the Dutchmen, and bent sail
for Bali, upon the eastern extremity of Java, I told
the story in detail of my recapture of the prahu. Prabu
was very grateful, for I had saved him a very valuable
cargo as well as vessel. Martin was delighted, calling
it jolly fun, and regretted only that he had not been
with me; but, observing that I looked gloomy, he said:</p>

<p>“Why, Claud, here are you—who have done a thing
so monstrously plucky, that in the navy it would have
earned you promotion—looking as glum as if you had
lost, not gained, a ship.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Martin, that ‘in the navy’ makes all the difference;
but, you see, if the Governor-General of Batavia
catches me, the kind of promotion I shall get
may be hanging. Yes,” I continued, looking angrily
towards Prabu, “while we have been sailing about under
the belief that we were simply honest nest-gatherers
and traders, we have been pirates, rebels, or something
of that kind, without knowing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Oh, bother!” exclaimed Martin, very seriously,—“that’s
true, but I never thought of it. Prabu, old fellow,
you have brought us into a pretty scrape with
your fire-arms and your Pangerans; so the least you
can do is to let us know what is likely to be the end
of it. No secrets any longer, if you please.”</p>

<p>“The young sahibs sought their servant, and begged
he would take them with him,” replied Prabu.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s true enough,” cried Martin; “but we
didn’t think we were taking service with a grim old
pirate, you know!”</p>

<p>“Prabu is no pirate; moreover, he would sacrifice
his own life rather than any harm should come to the
young sahibs.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is all very well, and I believe it,” answered
Martin; “still, you should have told us what we had
to expect, not kept us in the dark so long.”</p>

<p>“Sahib Martin,” he replied, earnestly, “you are
right; I might well have intrusted both with my secret,
for you are brave as lions; but, thanks to Allah! it is
not too late to make amends. Let them listen.”</p>

<p>Then he confessed, what we surmised from the
words of the Dutch captain—namely, that he had been
acting as agent for the Pangeran of Pugar, collecting
and selling his birds’-nests, and purchasing arms with
the money.</p>

<p>“Then,” said I, “there <i>is</i> a conspiracy afoot, and the
native princes are about to rise against their masters,
the Dutch.”</p>

<p>“Masters!” he exclaimed, scornfully—“the dogs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Dutch—the treacherous Hollanders—thieves and
plunderers of the East—fellows whose souls are in
their money-bags—the <i>masters</i> of the descendants of
the Susunans!” Then, as if bethinking his haste had
betrayed him into imprudence, he added, “But who is
Prabu, that he should prate of the affairs of princes?
Sahib,” he continued, “you will not betray me. Know,
then, that in every island of the archipelago, the people
are but biding their opportunity to throw off the
accursed yoke.”</p>

<p>“But, Prabu,” I asked, quite innocently, “why do
<i>you</i> dislike the Hollanders?”</p>

<p>“Dislike!” he exclaimed; “I hate them!—yes, with
the hereditary accumulated hatred of generations; nor
is it alone so with us islanders. Has not the Sahib
Claud told us how readily even the Chinese captain
forgot his hatred to me, for depriving him of his cargo
of nests, when hearing that I and the arms were beneath
the claws of these Dutch wolves? But,” he
added, “the sun is sinking; another day I will tell
the sahibs the history of the cruel doings of these
Dutch in Java, and they shall then judge whether our
hatred to them is groundless or not.”</p>

<small>HISTORY OF OUR CAPTAIN: HIS HATRED OF THE DUTCH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, as my brother and I were reclining
beneath the deck-awning, Prabu related the following
history:—</p>

<p>“I have told the sahibs how greatly I venerate the
memory of the Counselor Black, their uncle; as Allah
knows, it is with reason. When a little slave-boy, he
bought me from a harsh, cruel master, and being
pleased with my grateful behavior, and considering
I possessed talents, caused me to be educated for a
clerk—that is, had me taught the Dutch and English
languages. More, he would have given me my freedom,
but feared the jealousy of his fellow-rulers, to
whom it was known that I was the descendant of a
prince, and one too, once the direst and most hated
foe of their countrymen.”</p>

<p>“You, Prabu, descended from a prince!—a real,
right-down, royal highness?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“Have patience, sahib,” he replied; “for to the history
of that noble man I shall soon come. In the
Dutch books,” he continued, “I read the story of the
great deeds done by the Hollanders when they fought
to throw off the tyranny of Philip, King of Spain, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
how that, by virtue and bravery, from a nation of
slaves they became a free people: for this I could have
loved them. But in other books, I read that in the
East—except in China and Japan, where, for the sake
of gold, they behaved as truculent slaves—they have
been tyrants, more hateful and cruel than him whose
yoke they overthrew; and I first asked myself, whether
God had placed hearts in the breasts of Dutchmen,
and then hated them. The latter was for deeds done
to me and mine; but the sahibs shall judge for themselves.</p>

<p>“When the first Dutchman, under one Houtman,
found their way to the Archipelago, in the year 1595
of the Christian era, the island of Java was divided into
several kingdoms—Cheribon, Martaram, Bantam,
and Jacatra. It was not until thirty years after the
arrival of these locusts, that the supreme rule was held
chiefly by a great Susunan of the House of Martaram.
Upon their coming, they were received by the Javans
and other islanders with open arms; but these Dutch,
aye, and the Portuguese and English, who were already
established in the Archipelago, and almost as bad,
must have been the scum of their own countries; for,
taking advantage of the simplicity of the people, they
cheated and robbed them at every opportunity—nay,
behaved like demons, who considered all less cunning
than themselves as birds and beasts of the forest—lawful
prey.</p>

<p>“Thus, even the first fleet of these adventurers made
war upon Bantam and Saduya, and at Madura murdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the king and his family, while they were paying
them a friendly visit on board the fleet. Surely such
arts should have opened the eyes of the native princes
to the real character of their visitors, and have caused
them to prevent the coming of others!—but not so.
Fresh fleets, invited by the gains of their countrymen,
came; and, by making great professions of amity and
moderation, were permitted to establish themselves in
the kingdom of Jacatra. In gratitude for this concession,
the pirates arose against the prince, subdued his
kingdom, and built Batavia upon the site of his capital.
Having obtained a firm footing in the land, they
commenced a series of intrigues, setting the native
princes one against the other, occasionally aiding each,
but keeping faith with neither. Thus they gradually
became virtually masters of the country, although many
of the native princes were permitted to hold their rank
and titles. Among these was the great Susunan
Mangkorat, whom they had helped to the throne
against his younger brother. During this reign happened
what the Dutch call the <i>rebellion</i> of Surapati.</p>

<p>“That Surapati, sahibs, was my ancestor, and is a
name held holy in the memory of every true-blooded
islander.”</p>

<p>“Was he the born prince, then, of whom you told
us?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“Not so, sahib—not born a prince; far nobler, a self-made
one.”</p>

<p>“A successful rebel, then,” said my brother; but,
not noting this, Prabu continued:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Surapati, when a child of seven years of age,
was brought from Bali among the crowd of slaves
who were annually taken into Batavia by the Dutch,
whose ruin would have been brought about by their
own tyranny, had there been six other such men in
the island. Well, Surapati was bought by a Dutchman
of the name of Hesse, for whom he toiled, and was
well treated, till, forgetting that he was a slave, he
dared to fall in love with his master’s daughter—a
crime so heinous in the eyes of the Hollanders, that,
upon detection, the slave was severely flogged, and ordered
to be placed in the public stocks, where, with
sixty of his countrymen, he had to endure the scoffs
and personal insults of Europeans; but, sahibs, the
stocks could not prevent his brain from thinking, nor
his heart from beating. Thus the wood that galled
his limbs kindled in his breast a hatred that, to his last
day, never became quenched, and which, dying, he bequeathed
to his descendants, in whose hearts it burns,
even now, as fiercely as ever.</p>

<p>“Well, one night, after weeks of confinement,
Surapati succeeded in releasing himself and countrymen,
and, having slain the Dutch sentinels, they fled
to the mountains near Batavia, upon which town, from
time to time, the band made such fierce raids that it
became the terror of the inhabitants, who began to put
the city in a state of defense, and armed themselves to
their very teeth. Surapati now, finding the place too
strong and well prepared, led his small band eastward,
aye, to the very capital of the Susunan in Casard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Ever bold and fearless, he one day alone entered the
palace of the Susunan, and dared to shame the monarch
upon his throne for his great amity with the rapacious
foreigners, whose puppet he had become. And
the Susunan—who, although he feared the power of
the Dutch, at heart was disgusted at the thraldom in
which they had placed him—agreed to give secret aid
and countenance to any design that Surapati and his
patriot band might form against them.</p>

<p>“When the Hollanders discovered in whose dominions
their now terrible enemy was hiding, they sent
an ambassador, demanding that he should be given up
to them; but the Susunan evaded the request, upon the
plea of respecting the laws of hospitality; at the same
time, however, he told them they might search any or
every part of his dominions. Having obtained this
concession, the Dutch, to capture this little band, sent
one thousand men, in addition to those they had already
in the Susunan’s dominions. So great a force
would have compelled Surapati to flee, but, then, his
patriotic designs against the hated Hollanders had obtained
for him the friendship of the prime minister,
who not only gave him his daughter in marriage, but,
with the permission of his royal master, espoused his
son-in-law’s cause.</p>

<p>“Thus, at the head of a comparatively small force,
Surapati met the foreigners in the field successfully,
defeating and killing them to a man. After this victory,
Surapati retired still further eastward, and, seizing
upon several provinces, established an independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
kingdom, which, for twenty years, was happy and
prosperous under his rule; although, during all that
period, he never lost an opportunity of meeting and
harassing the enemy. Sahibs, had he lived a few
more years, that great man would have hunted the
pirates from the island; and in that very attempt he
died, for although conquering place after place, he
never lost one, and at length fell in battle with the
Dutch.”</p>

<p>“Well, Prabu,” said Martin, “he <i>was</i> a plucky fellow,
and deserved all he got but his death.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said I, “and deserved a monument to his
memory.”</p>

<p>“His monument is the hatred in the hearts of his
countrymen—a hatred never to be appeased, if only
in memory of the dastardly treatment of his corpse,”
replied Prabu. “For a long time after the battle,”
he added, “the Dutch were sorely grieved, for they
could not find the body of the hero: they were afraid
that the soul would re-inhabit it, and bring back their
enemy—so they offered a large reward for its discovery.
The reward was tempting to some degenerate
Javans, for, forgetting their lord, they showed the
Dutch chief the grave; but it was level—no one could
discern a tomb. The body was, however, dug for and
found. It was still entire as when alive, and shed a
perfume like a flower-garden. The Hollanders bore it
away to their camp, and, placing it in a sitting posture
in a chair, the officers took the corpse by the hand,
saluting it according to the custom of their country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
and tauntingly exclaiming, ‘This is the hero Surapati,
the mighty warrior, the enemy of the Dutch!’ After
this they threw the body into a great fire and burned it
to ashes. For this,” concluded Prabu, in a greatly excited
state, “do I hate the Dutch; and for thousands
of acts, still worse, do my countrymen abhor them!”</p>

<p>“And I do not wonder,” said I; “but why should
the Chinese, foreigners like themselves, and equally
as money-loving, share in that hatred?”</p>

<p>“For numberless deeds of cruelty and oppression,
and not the least the great and cold-blooded massacre
of their countrymen in 1740, when in Batavia alone,
on that one occasion, more than ten thousand were
slain.”</p>

<p>“But surely, Prabu, the brutes must have made some
<i>show</i> of an excuse for such butchery!”</p>

<p>“Yes—that the Celestials were meditating a conspiracy
to drive them from Java; but the truth was,
that the Chinese had flocked into Batavia to a number
that alarmed the Dutch. Jealous also of their intelligence
and wealth, they goaded the Celestials by
excessive taxation, arbitrary punishments, and frightful
executions, until the latter could bear no more, and
threatened to rise in rebellion. This was sufficient for
the European rulers, who commenced a system of persecution;
still, it was not until 1740 that the revolt
commenced.</p>

<p>“The crisis was brought about by the forcible seizure
of a number of Chinese, and their deportation to
Ceylon, under pretext of their being engaged in committing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
irregularities in the neighborhood of Batavia.
Exasperated by this tyranny, the Chinese in the vicinity
of the city, who were not restrained by the presence
of a military force, committed acts of violence,
excess, and cruelty. Taking advantage of this, the
Dutch promulgated a story of a <i>wicked</i> and <i>long-meditated</i>
conspiracy, to destroy the European authorities.
Between the Dutch troops and the armed mob
of Chinese in the environs, several indecisive actions
took place. On the 7th day of October, it was discovered
that the Chinese quarter of the town was on
fire. This was construed into an artifice to mask an
attempt to murder the European inhabitants in the
confusion of the conflagration.</p>

<p>“The habitual timidity of the Dutch colonists took
alarm; the massacre of the Chinese inhabitants of Batavia
forthwith commenced, and was in a few hours
formally authorized by an order of the Government,
which directed that none but the women and children
should be spared. A band of brutal sailors was landed
from the fleet in the roads, to carry this order into
effect; the doors of the Chinese houses were burst
open, and the inhabitants dragged out and massacred,
without offering the smallest resistance. The city was
in a state of conflagration, and nothing was to be seen
throughout but fire, murder, and rapine—victims and
executioners; it was not until the twenty-second of
the same month that an armistice was proclaimed. The
effects of this abominable tyranny were felt from one
extremity of Java to the other: the Chinese who escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the slaughter marched to the east, and leagued
themselves with the Susunan, who were very willing
to be rid of their common oppressors; and a series of
revolts, wars, or rebellions was the consequence, which
continued, for a period of fifteen years, to desolate the
fairest portions of the island, and to exhaust its resources.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br>

<small>ADVENTURES WITH A BIG SNAKE AND A MAN-EATER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, after a three weeks’ run along the coast, we
arrived at the mouth of the River Progo—which,
rising in the mountains of Kadu, in the interior of
Java, empties itself into the sea at Martaram—we
found it necessary to ship fresh water; and for that
purpose three men, with a sampan and several empty
casks, were ordered by Prabu to proceed up the
stream. Then my brother and I were positively suffering
for want of animal food. I say my brother and
I, because the only provisions the natives cared about
were rice, fish, and water; nay, so abstemious are
these people, that it is a common boast among them
that when <i>necessary</i>, as in the case of troops in the
field, they can live upon the leaves of trees alone.
Thus it was that, when Martin found the sampan crew
were going up the river, he said:</p>

<p>“Claud, old fellow, we shall get as thin as weasels
if we don’t soon get something better than rice and
fish to live upon. What say you to going with these
fellows, and trying our rifles among the game in the
interior, or at least along the banks?”</p>

<p>“Nothing I should like better. I will persuade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
Prabu to give us permission.” But the latter required
no persuasion; for not only did he give us leave, but
a sampan to ourselves, and Kati, who had been a
mighty hunter in his native isle, for our guide and
mentor.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this, in an hour or two we
were pulling up the river to get beyond the tide;
which, by the way, being at the flood, much lessened
our labor, for, merely resting upon our oars, we were
swept rapidly up the stream without any exertion of
our own.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the spot where the water was
to be obtained, we told the crew of the other sampan
to fill their casks and return to the prahu without
waiting for us; then, by Kati’s advice, we proceeded
up the river, until we had reached within, as he believed,
a few leagues of the ancient city of Yugyacarta.
Here we landed, and, having secured our boat
to the trunk of one of the thousand mangrove-trees
along the banks, advanced into the jungle, preceded
by Kati, who beat the path for us; but, as we left the
river further and further in our rear, I began to have
some misgivings as to our safety.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” I said, “we should beat up a tiger, Martin?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, quite coolly, “suppose we do, we
shall have to shoot the fellow, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“Hilloa! what have we here?” he exclaimed, discharging
his rifle into a flock of some thirty or forty
birds, which rose and flew through the foliage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
trees. Looking up, my eyes were dazzled by the
wonderful effect of the sun upon their plumage: never
had I seen so beautiful a sight.</p>

<p>“Sahib, they are God’s birds,” said Kati.</p>

<p>“God’s birds!” I repeated, picking up two that had
fallen. “They are birds of paradise, Martin.”</p>

<p>“Birds of paradise!” he repeated, examining the
wondrous beauty of their plumage. “What a pity I
have killed them! However, it can’t be helped—we
must keep them for specimens. But I wonder how
they came here. I have always heard that they are
only to be found in Papua and the Moluccas.”</p>

<p>“Have got away, sahib, from some prahu wrecked
upon the coast.”</p>

<p>“More likely they have escaped from the aviary of
some native prince. But,” said I, as we walked on,
“do you remember the queer stories we used to read
at school about these beautiful creatures, Martin?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well then—how that they puzzled all the learned,
who declared that they were inhabitants of air, living
upon the dews of heaven, and never resting below?”</p>

<p>“Well, Claud, there was good reason for the supposition;
for I do recollect having read that all the
earlier specimens brought to Europe were without
feet.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but that originated with the natives of the
Moluccas, who, although savages, were very cunning.
For instance, descrying the great admiration Europeans
had for the beauty of their plumage, and knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the high prices they would pay for them, before
bringing the birds to market they cut off their feet—which,
as you see, are ugly, and their <i>only</i> deformity.
One deceit led to another. The purchaser, finding the
birds without legs, naturally inquired after those members,
and the seller, as naturally, began to assert that
they had none. Thus far the European was imposed
upon by others—in all the rest he imposed upon himself.
Seeing so beautiful a bird without legs, he concluded
that it could live only in air, where legs were
unnecessary. The extraordinary splendor of its
plumage assisted this deception; and as it had heavenly
beauty, so was it asserted to have a heavenly
residence; hence its name, and all the false reports
that have been propagated concerning it.”</p>

<p>“But how do the natives catch them?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“By concealing themselves in the trees where they
resort; and having covered themselves up from sight
in a bower made of the branches, they shoot at the
birds with arrows made of reeds; and, as they assert,
if they happen to kill their king, they then have a
good chance of killing the greatest part of the flock.
The chief mark by which they know the king is by
the end of the feathers in his tail, which have eyes
like those of a peacock. When they have taken a
number of these birds their usual method is to gut
them and cut off their legs; they then run a hot iron
into the body, which dries up the internal moisture,
and, filling the cavity with salt and spices, they sell
them to Europeans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Stay—listen, Claud; there is some great beast
near,” cried my brother, interrupting me, and at the
same time bringing his rifle to the “present.”</p>

<p>I trembled, but followed his example, keeping my
finger upon the trigger; nearly a hundred yards before
us—(we were just then ourselves in a cleared
space amongst tall grass)—the rattans in the jungle
bent and crackled, and soon the head of the new-comer
presented itself.</p>

<p>“Big pig, sahib; don’t both shoot at once,” cried
Kati, drawing his creese.</p>

<p>“Martin,” I said, “be wary and cool; aim between
the eyes, and I will reserve my fire in case you miss.”</p>

<p>On came piggy, not with a run, but at a gentle,
ambling pace, coolly and defiantly looking us in the
face—so gently, indeed, that with patience we might
have bagged him; but before he advanced more than
a dozen yards, my impulsive brother fired, exclaiming,
“There’s a dead pig for you!”</p>

<p>But not so: the bullet, passing through his neck,
did but arouse the animal, making it change its trot
into a charge.</p>

<p>“Load quickly, Martin,” cried I, at the same time
sending a bullet that hit the pig in the forehead, and
sent him over, snorting, grunting, and fruitlessly endeavoring
to get upon his legs again.</p>

<p>“Bravo, Claud—a capital shot! but now let us put
the poor brute out of his misery.”</p>

<p>“No, sahib—not hurry,” cried Kati; “pig gore you
with his tusks—he only sham being so bad he can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
stand.” And with his <i>sarong</i>—which he had taken
off and bound tightly round his left arm—and creese
in hand, he ran towards the animal; but when within
a couple of yards of it, he suddenly came to a dead
halt, and there stood as if terror-stricken. But so
were we, for we saw rise from amongst the tall grass
to the height of a man, a huge <i>liboya</i> (a species of
boa-constrictor common to Java); and there for a
moment it remained, putting forth its forked tongue,
and glaring at pig and man, as if undecided upon
which to spring. A grunt or cry of terror, however,
from the former settled the matter, for the reptile
instantly fell upon the pig and began to twine itself
around him, crushing his bones.</p>

<p>“There goes a month’s rations for the whole crew,”
said Martin.</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it;” and, taking a good aim, I
fired, but, missing the head, the bullet passed through
its neck. The huge reptile now uncoiled itself from
the pig, and began to strike his tail around with the
rapidity and power of a scythe mowing grass by
steam—sending the mud, sand, and dirt about in
showers.</p>

<p>“Sahibs, go not near snake, but fire again; while I
go and get rope from sampan.”</p>

<p>“What on earth does he want with the rope?” said
Martin. But Kati had disappeared, and I was too
much engaged to reply, for I was reloading my rifle.
That being done, I again fired and hit the serpent.
This shot, however, only excited its fury the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
and caused it to raise such a whirlwind of dust and
mud, that, to avoid being blinded, we were compelled
to retreat some distance.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Martin, when the reptile had become
quiet, and the dust allayed; “let us send a volley.”</p>

<p>This we did, and effectively, for both bullets passed
through its head.</p>

<p>“Bravo, Claud! we have saved our bacon—or pork;
the snake is dead,” cried Martin, advancing towards
the carcass of the pig.</p>

<p>“Not so—if you value your life, remain where you
are,” I replied; for I saw that the reptile, notwithstanding
its mortal wounds, was writhing and twisting
about in such a manner as to be dangerous for any
person to approach it. Kati, however, who now came
running up to us, carrying a rope with a noose at
one end, had no such fears. Going within a few
yards, and handling it as dextrously as an American
of the prairies would a lasso, he by one throw sent it
over the head.</p>

<p>“Now, sahibs, pull tight—choke snake, and we
draw him to sampan.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Martin, in astonishment. “It
is the pig we want in the sampan, not this brute of
a snake.”</p>

<p>“Sahib, yes—he not dead yet—we fasten rope to
sampan—then drag him ’bout till no more ’live.”</p>

<p>“But that’s no answer,” replied Martin; “let him
die here. What do we want with it on board the
boat? Let’s take the pig.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Come, come, Martin,” I said, “let us humor Kati;
he is a native, and understands what he is about.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us secure the pig first, and I will help
you,” he replied, proud of his first game, and fearing
to be robbed by some wild beast.</p>

<p>We complied, and by our united efforts hauled the
snake to the river’s edge; then, fastening the rope to
the stern, we got into the boat and dragged the reptile,
still alive and swimming about in the water like an
eel, up to the other sampan, the crew of which, having
filled their casks, were about departing. At a
word, however, from Kati, one of the men, taking the
end of the rope that had been fastened to our sampan,
ascended a tree till he reached a forked branch; throwing
it over this, he let one end down to his comrades,
who then hauled up the snake—some twenty feet in
length, and as thick as the body of a boy twelve years
of age. Then the man upon the branch, placing a
sharp knife between his teeth, began to descend, holding
on to the slimy body by means of his legs and one
hand, ripping it up and skinning it as he came slowly
down. By the time he came to the ground again,
he had no pleasant appearance, his mahogany-colored
skin being all besmeared with the reptile’s blood. But
the result was worth the pains taken to procure it,
for in a very short time the natives had emptied one
of the casks and re-filled it with the fat, or rather oil—a
commodity so marketable that it proved a valuable
gift to Prabu.</p>

<p>Having thus shipped our prizes and dispatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
them to the prahu, we pulled back in the direction of
our hunting-ground, with the intention of looking
after other game; for one pig, we knew, would be but
a sorry store for the long voyage before us.</p>

<p>“I wish we could just bag a few of those Argus
pheasants we used to have at Mynheer’s,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“About as probable as to find the golden pheasant
of China!” replied I. “Why, the Argus pheasant is
only found in Sumatra.” (<i>Apropos</i> of the common
pheasant, my young reader is not perhaps aware that
its progenitors were first brought to Europe from the
banks of the Pharsis, a river of Colchis, in Asia
Minor, and from which they derive their name.)
“Besides,” I added, “it would be barbarous indeed
to slaughter so beautiful a bird with a rifle-bullet.
What would they think of such unsportsmanlike conduct
in America?”</p>

<p>“Oh! bother about what they think in America,
Claud, when we are dying for want of fresh provisions;
still, I admire their beauty as much as you.”</p>

<p>“Aye, brother, just now you would think one very
beautiful, especially with bread-sauce.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Claud; if I can only get sight of one,
we will have him, and dressed, too, before we return
to the prahu; nevertheless, they <i>are</i> pretty birds.
Don’t you remember darling old Goldsmith’s anecdote
about their beautiful plumage?”</p>

<p>“Repeat it, Martin, and it will turn you from your
barbarous design.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Well, then, after telling us that ‘next to the peacock
the pheasant is the most beautiful of birds, as
well for the nice color of their plumes as for their
happy mixtures and variety,’ he says that Crœsus,
King of Lydia, being seated upon the throne, adorned
with royal magnificence and all the barbaric pomp of
Eastern splendor, asked Solon, if he had ever beheld
anything so fine? The Greek philosopher, no way
moved by the objects before him, or taking a pride
in his native simplicity, replied that, after having seen
the beautiful plumage of the pheasant, he could be astonished
at no other finery.</p>

<p>“There, Claud, you have the anecdote; but what
does it prove? Not that Solon did not like them with
bread-sauce, but that the old Greek, having a reputation
for wisdom, wanted to sustain it by saying a
clever thing, or that, in his heart, he looked upon
the king’s riches and splendor as the fox did at the
grapes—‘they were so much beyond his reach that
they must be sour.’ But, hilloa, Kati! what’s a-do
now?” he said, as he saw our companion take off his
sarong, and bind it tightly around his left arm.</p>

<p>“Hush!” replied the latter, placing his finger upon
his lips, and pointing to a small boat, rowed by a
single inmate, that had just rounded a bend of the
river and was approaching us.</p>

<p>“Well, what matters? He is only one and we are
three,” replied Martin, thinking Kati regarded the
boatman as some suspicious personage; but when the
latter, pointing in the wake of the boat, whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the word “man-eater,” he trembled indeed, and so did
I; for we could now see the long scales, dark, hideous
body, and snout of a huge crocodile. The man, too,
evidently knew his danger, for he was pulling with
might and main to outrun the reptile, knowing that if
it once got so far ahead that it could get its tail beneath
the boat, he would himself soon fill its jaws.</p>

<p>“What shall we do—what <i>can</i> we do—to help the
poor fellow?” I cried.</p>

<p>“Wait till its snout gets a little higher above water,
and then send a bullet into him,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“No, no, sahib—not good; man-eater not care for
that—his scales like one wall.”</p>

<p>“Well, what then, Kati? I will not sit here and
see a human being quietly fall into the jaws of a brute
like that, if I can help it.”</p>

<p>“Me help it, sahib; me kill man-eater almost before
grow to one man.”</p>

<p>But now our attention became fixed with terrible interest
upon the scene before us: the boatman, panting,
exerted himself to his utmost, the reptile still following,
and evidently gaining upon the boat.</p>

<p>“I should like to put a bit of this salt upon his
tail,” said Martin, fingering the lock of his rifle.</p>

<p>“No, no, not good send bullet—may want it if me
not kill him,” replied Kati.</p>

<p>“Yes, let us reserve our charges,” said I; but the
next instant the crocodile had passed under the boat;
there was a wild moan, and man and sampan were
some yards in the air; but as soon, almost, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
had again touched the water, Kati, who had leaped
from our boat, and was between the boatsman and
the reptile, the latter—apparently astonished that a
man should be swimming boldly <i>toward</i> instead of
<i>from</i> him—rested for an instant. That instant, however,
was enough for the brave Kati to compose himself
for the coming struggle. We kept our fingers
on the triggers, and our rifles in such a position that,
should the monster obtain the least advantage over its
antagonists, we might send a bullet into its eye, or,
if such a fortunate opportunity presented itself, its
belly—for, you see, the scales are bullet-proof. Suddenly,
the brute opened its huge jaws, a thrill of horror
passed through our frames, and on the instant I
should have fired but for Martin, who exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Great Heaven! Kati has thrust his arm down the
brute’s throat!” and so he had, and immediately afterwards
the surface of the water became tinged with
black-red blood.</p>

<p>By opening his jaws, the reptile had given his enemy
an opportunity, for at once Kati thrust in one arm
up to the shoulder, while with the other he had
stabbed it in the throat with his creese; and by repeating
these blows rapidly, at the same time that the
water entered the mouth, the body had swollen to the
size of a large tub, and in a few minutes more the eater
of men was dead and harmless, and Kati was ashore
receiving our congratulations.</p>

<p>The delight of the native whose life had been so
miraculously saved was almost frantic: he fell down
before Kati, kissed his feet, and clasped his knees;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
but upon the body of the crocodile—which, when it
had floated near the bank, we dragged ashore—he
vented the most childish spite, stamping upon it with
his feet, calling it the most horrible names, and stabbing
it in the belly.</p>

<p>Truly, it was hideous to look upon—by far worse
than when in the water. It was a large, double-crested
crocodile, of the species common to the rivers
of Java, being, from the tip of the snout to the end
of the tail, twenty-five feet in length.</p>

<p>I may here remark that, although the feat performed
by Kati seemed to us at that time very wonderful, it
is one not at all uncommon among the wild tribes of
the East; also, that there are many methods of taking
the crocodile. For instance, in Siam, in the rivers of
which these reptiles swarm, the hunters throw three
or four strong nets across a river, at proper distances
from each other, so that if the animal breaks through
the first it may be caught by one of the others. When
first taken it lashes its tail in all directions in its endeavor
to escape, but by so doing exhausts its
strength; then the natives approach their prisoner
in boats, and pierce him with their weapons
till it is weakened by loss of blood; they then tie
up its mouth, and with the same cord fasten the head
to the tail, bending the back like a bow. The animal
thus taken is not killed, but brought into subjection
by the slaves of Siamese noblemen, who keep them in
small lakes in the grounds of their homes for their
amusement, and who, it is said, so far tame the reptiles
that they can bridle and ride them like horses.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br>

<small>WE PICK UP A CHINESE STORY-TELLER, WHO SENDS US
TO SLEEP.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> our new acquaintance had exhausted his expressions
of gratitude to Kati, and gratified his spite
upon the body of the dead reptile, he told us that he
was a servant of the Chief of Yugyacarta, who had
sent him to the coast with a message to the captain
of a Chinese junk. At this information, Kati’s eyes
became lighted up with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Truly,” said he, “this is fortunate; for it is to that
great chief thy servant is now proceeding, on a mission
with his captain. Will my brother,” he added,
“cut short his journey, and lead his servant to the
great man, for after quitting the river, the road to
the town is long and intricate?”</p>

<p>“Is it possible, under heaven, that a man who has
been saved from the jaws of a man-eater can deny
aught to his preserver?”</p>

<p>“Hilloa, Kati!” asked the curious Martin, “what
business can you have with the Chief of Yugyacarta?”</p>

<p>“My <i>master’s</i> business, oh sahib, and therefore to
be disclosed only at his command,” was the quiet
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“You are well answered, Mr. Curious,” said I;
“but, Kati, how long will you be absent? Shall we
await your return?”</p>

<p>“Let the sahibs remain until the buffalo returns to
his pasture (sundown), and their servant will be
grateful; but let them not wait after the sun has gone,
for the captain will be in fear that misfortune has
overtaken them.”</p>

<p>So saying, Kati and the stranger entered the latter’s
boat and pulled up the stream.</p>

<p>“Bother!” exclaimed Martin, “upon what errand
is that fellow going to the chief? More mystery—I
don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Martin; there is <i>no</i> mystery that Prabu
will not explain when we return on board. As for
Kati, you cannot blame him for being faithful to his
master; but now let us beat the jungle for a week’s
rations.”</p>

<p>“Well, old fellow, perhaps, after all, you are right,
so let us lose no more time,” he replied.</p>

<p>Then, having secured the sampan to the stump of
a tree, we shouldered our rifles, and soon entered the
forest. For several hours we wandered stealthily, for
fear of tigers, among huge trees, luxuriant palms, and
the teak (the oak of Java, the only island of the
Archipelago in which it abounds).</p>

<p>The teak, like the oak, takes from eighty to a hundred
years to reach maturity, rising then to a height
of eighty or a hundred feet, and having a girth of
from five to eight feet. Anent this monarch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Indian forest and “the brave old oak,” Crawford
writes, “It is singular, that among the innumerable
varieties of woods which exist in both worlds, from
the Arctic Circle to the Equator, two only—the oak
and the teak—should, by their strength, durability,
and abundance, be fit for the higher purposes of the
arts, domestic and naval architecture, and the fabrication
of great machinery. The geographical distribution
of the oak has a wider limit than the teak. It
exists in Europe, Asia, and America, to within ten
degrees of the Tropics. The teak exists in Asia only,
in the countries lying between China and Persia, within
the Tropics—being found but in the southern peninsula
of India, in India beyond the Ganges to the confines
of China, and in the island of Java.</p>

<p>“In comparing the qualities of the two woods, those
of the teak will be found considerably to preponderate.
It is equally strong as the oak, and somewhat
more buoyant; its durability is more uniform and
decided; and to insure that durability, it demands less
care and preparation, for it may be put in use almost
green from the forest, without danger of dry or wet
rot. It is fit to endure all climates and alternations of
climate; the oak, on the contrary, cracks and is destroyed
by such alternations, and particularly by exposure
to the rays of a tropical sun. The oak contains
an acid, which corrodes and destroys iron; the teak
not only has no such acid, but even contains an essential
oil, which tends to preserve iron. The great
superiority of the oak over the teak consists in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
utility in the fabrication of vessels for holding liquids.
The strong odor which the teak imparts to all liquids
which are solvents of the essential oil in which that
odor is contained, makes it unfit to be used for holding
them. It makes good water-casks, but is unfit for
wine, or any spirit but arrack, to which it imparts
some of that peculiar flavor which some persons affect
to relish. Another noteworthy forest tree is the
<i>nipah</i>, or atap palm, whose leaves afford the natives
thatching for their house-roofs and matting for their
floors, and from the sap of which is extracted a drinkable
wine.”</p>

<p>Then we had to beat through bushes of the prickly
rattan-cane, so well known to my readers, but used,
in the Archipelago, for ligature and cordage, and possessing
a fruit of the size of a pullet’s egg. Then
through little forests of the bamboo, whose uses are
so numerous that they may be mentioned as commencing
with the cradle and ending with the grave; for it
helps to form the first and yields the material for the
last human garment.</p>

<p>Well, near sundown, or, as a Javanese would say,
“the hour when the buffalo is brought back from the
pastures,” we returned to the sampan with a tolerably
successful bag of game—namely, a young fawn and
a dozen birds, chiefly partridges and a species of
wood-pigeon.</p>

<p>“Not bad sport, Martin,” said I, as we tossed the
game into the boat.</p>

<p>“No—and the sooner we reach the prahu now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
better; for in another hour or so, when the beasts
of the forest come down to the river to take their
evening draught, the crocodiles will be out in
swarms.”</p>

<p>“Shall we wait no longer for Kati?”</p>

<p>“No—it would be useless,” replied Martin. “But,
hilloa!” he exclaimed, “who have we here?”</p>

<p>“A footsore traveler, Martin—<i>that</i> you can easily
see by his limp,” said I; but the next minute the
stranger, who was a Chinese, and, from his broken
Dutch, I thought, of the poorer class of the traders
of the Campong, cried:</p>

<p>“For the love of Fo, and their own God, let not the
noble youths put off their sampan, till they have heard
the sad story of the wretched Si-Ling!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like these Chinese fellows. Shall we push
off?” said my brother.</p>

<p>“For shame, Martin! Let us at least hear what he
has to say.”</p>

<p>At which the Chinese, taking courage, said:</p>

<p>“Know then, oh noble youth, that thy servant, the
miserable and insignificant Si-Ling, two moons since
left Batavia to go to Yugyacarta, where he has since
lived with his wife and two children; but, alas! the
jungle-fever seized and carried his whole family to
the yellow stream (<i>i. e.</i>, they had died by fever) three
days since. Overcome with grief thy servant started
this morning at daybreak in a sampan to reach the
coast, where he hoped to find some junk or prahu,
whose noble captain would take him back to Batavia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
but, alas! thy slave chose an unfortunate day, for
when within two leagues of this spot he was surprised
by robbers, who, enticing him ashore, took from him
his worldly goods and sampan—leaving him, as the
noble youths may see, with naught but a bag of
fruits.” Then, with a deep groan, he threw the latter,
which had been suspended by a string round his
neck, upon the bank.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Si-Ling,” said Martin, “you have not
told us how you got your living in Yugyacarta; and
we must know that; for if, as an honest trader or laborer,
we will take you with us; if, as a vagabond—and
you look more like that than anything else—well,
you will have to sleep under a palm, and tramp it in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“Know then, oh noble youth, that Si-Ling is a great
scholar, and the son of a scholar; for his worthy
parent was a mandarin of letters, and a member of
the college of Han-Lin, at Pekin: thus thy servant
is learned in history, and having studied that of Java
since he has been here, relates stories to the nobles
who seek amusement.”</p>

<p>“A professional story-teller, then?” said I.</p>

<p>“The noble youth has divined aright: his servant,
Si-Ling, is of the noble profession of story-tellers.”</p>

<p>“More likely of the <i>ignoble</i> profession of rogues,
if there be any truth in physiognomy,” whispered
Martin—adding: “Well, Mr. Si-Ling, get in, and
stow yourself away in the stern; and as we float down
the stream—for, as the tide having turned, we don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
want the oars—you may give us a taste of your quality.”</p>

<p>“May the bones of the noble youths rest with those
of their ancestors, and their descendants ever piously
keep their tombs well swept, and strewn with fresh
flowers!” replied the Chinese, getting into the sampan.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” replied Martin, laughing. “You
are kind, and we are grateful; nevertheless, we are
in no hurry for anything half so good.”</p>

<p>When, however, we had put off, and were floating
down the stream, he said:</p>

<p>“Now, my friend, for a ‘taste of your quality.’
Tell us a story.”</p>

<p>“The noble youths are of the American Republic?”
said the Chinese, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; so go on, and abuse the Dutch as much
as you like.”</p>

<p>“The story thy servant will tell is truth, and shows
even how early the Dutch influence in Java began to
change the Javanese princes from lions into wolves.
The great Susunan Mangkorat, having entered into
a treaty with the Dutch, greatly to the injury of his
people and nobles, a certain chief, named Truna Jaya,
rose in rebellion against him, with the hope only of
being able to rescue his royal master from his false
friends, the Hollanders; but Truna, being unfortunate,
was defeated, and compelled to fly to the
mountains of Antang. There he remained with a few
of his faithful followers, until, reduced by want, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
was glad to make overtures of surrender. These were
accepted; but Truna, doubtful of the Susunan’s good
faith while under the influence of the Dutch, refused
to leave his fastness until better assurance of his safety
had been given. Accordingly, his own uncle, the
Prince of Madura, accompanied by a Dutch officer,
was sent to beguile him. The unhappy prince then
appeared before the monarch, bound with cords, and
with his wives, who were the Susunan’s own sisters.
The Susunan, pretending to be affected by the agony
of his sisters, pardoned his brother-in-law, and promised
to give him preferment; and great was the joy
of the family of Truna, while he went to change his
garment for one in which alone he could receive favors
from his sovereign. But guess, oh, noble youths,
the horror of the princesses, when, upon their husband’s
return into the royal presence, the Susunan
cried:</p>

<p>“‘My brother, Truna Jaya, when I was at Tagal I
made a vow that this, my creese—Blaba—should never
be sheathed until in your breast.’</p>

<p>“On these words the nobles brought the unhappy
man to the foot of the throne, from whence the Susunan,
rising, stabbed him to the heart; and then commanded
every noble to strike his creese into his body.
The corpse being thus mangled, the Susunan arose
again, crying in a loud voice:</p>

<p>“‘Let his heart be devoured.’</p>

<p>“The chiefs, obedient, rushed upon the body again,
and, tearing out the heart, divided it into fragments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
of a nail’s breadth, devouring it accordingly. The
head they laid at the foot of the throne, but it was
afterwards carried in procession before the Susunan;
and when he retired at night to rest, he used it as a
mat to wipe his feet upon. To such a demon,” concluded
the Chinese, “had the vile Hollanders changed
a prince of Java!”</p>

<p>“The savage beast!” exclaimed my brother; “but
where were the civilized Dutch all this time?”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>“Standing with arms folded, looking upon the
scene; and that, too, oh, noble youth, although their
generals had pledged their knightly honor for Truna’s
safety.”</p>

<p>“It is a horrible tale, and almost impossible to believe,”
said I; nevertheless, it was gospel truth.</p>

<p>“It is but one of many, many incidents in the history
of this land, that has sown hatred in the hearts
of its people to the Dutch,” replied the Chinese; “but,”
he added, “before thy servant relates another story,
he prays of the noble youths to partake of this fruit—it
is fresh-gathered.”</p>

<p>And, oh! how our eyes sparkled, as he brought from
his bag some slices of that most delicious of all known
fruits, a mangosteen. This fruit, it is said, meets
the approbation of persons of the greatest diversity
of tastes in other matters—whether that diversity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
arises from peculiarity of constitution or from national
habits and antipathies. It is mildly acid, and
has an extreme delicacy of flavor, without being
luscious or cloying. In external appearance it has
the look of a ripe pomegranate, but is smaller and
more completely globular. A thick rind, hard on the
outside, but soft and succulent within, incloses large
seeds or kernels, surrounded by a soft, semi-transparent,
snow-white pulp, now and then having a very
slight crimson blush. This pulp is the edible part of
the fruit, and persons in robust health may, without
prejudice, eat a much larger quantity of it than of
any other.</p>

<p>And as we had been some time without refreshment,
we partook of this mangosteen to an extent that
would have been injurious with any other fruit.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Martin, “this is refreshing after that
horrible story; but proceed, Mr. Si-Ling—let us have
another; of course, it will not be to the advantage of
the Dutch.”</p>

<p>“It will not,” replied the Chinese; “but the noble
youth shall judge for himself:—</p>

<p>“Since the earliest coming of the Dutch into Java,
it has been their policy to set the native princes by
the ears, and then take advantage of the internecine
quarrels to increase their own power. Sometimes they
would dethrone one sovereign and place a rival in his
seat. One of the princes so raised to the throne was
the Pangeran of Pugar. Now, the Prince of Sourabaya,
Jayeng Rono, was his dearest friend and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
confidential adviser, as also was the Prince of Madura.
Unfortunately, Jayeng Rono fell under the displeasure
of the Dutch—either, it is supposed, because he
had thwarted some of their ambitious designs, or was
wanting in subserviency. However, be that as it may,
the Dutch general one day sent to the Susunan, demanding
his life might be taken.</p>

<p>“The poor sovereign, who had not long before lost
his friend, the Prince of Madura, almost paralyzed
with astonishment and terror, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“‘What! I have already lost my right hand;
would these Hollanders also take my left? No—it
shall not be.’</p>

<p>“Then, without giving an answer to the Dutch—for
he feared to offend them—he dispatched a messenger
at once to his friend, who was absent from the capital,
Cartasura, informing him that the Dutch demanded
his life, but that, if he chose to resist, he
should be secretly aided and abetted. The noble-minded
Jayeng Rono, however, clearly foreseeing that
resistance would involve the ruin, not only of himself,
but of his whole family, came to the disinterested resolution
of sacrificing his own life to secure the safety
of his friends and relations, and therefore at once repaired
to Cartasura to meet his fate. Here he had
many sad audiences with the Susunan. The latter,
finding Jayeng would not fly, promised to protect his
family, and complied with his request to appoint his
brother to the place left vacant by his death. At
length, the warrant for the prince’s execution came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
from Batavia. The Susunan summoned him to the
palace, and as, without a retainer, the old man (for
Jayeng Rono <i>was</i> very old) entered the courtyard, he
was met by the public executioner, who dispatched
him upon the spot. So terrible, oh, noble youths, has
been the tyranny and oppression of the Dutch in
Java!” concluded the Chinese, but, as I thought, with
a curious leer in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Horrible!” said I; “but, Martin, I feel unaccountably
sleepy.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” replied my brother, with a yawn; “the—the
mangosteen hasn’t agreed with us.”</p>

<p>As for me, I could barely keep my ears open to
listen to the concluding part, or rather epilogue to the
<i>historiette</i>, which ran thus:—</p>

<p>“But, oh, noble youths, the wicked are always punished,
in this world or the next; so the murder of
Jayeng Rono was fearfully avenged. The most
formidable and destructive rebellion which has ever
been known in the East broke out. Joyopuspito,
brother to the deceased chief, accepted of his office,
but only to use the influence which it afforded him for
revenge. He subdued all the districts in his vicinity—called
to his assistance the people of Bali—was
joined by the Madurese, and by several rebel princes
of the House of Martaram; so that this formidable
insurrection only terminated by his death, in the succeeding
reign, after desolating the country for a great
many years. The Chief of Sourabaya, in the many
actions which he fought with the Dutch, and in all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
proceedings, displayed so much enterprise, spirit, and
conduct, that, but for the superior equipments and
military science of the Europeans, he must have acquired
the sovereignty of the island.”</p>

<small>WE ARE HOODWINKED BY THE CHINESE, WHO ROBS US
OF OUR ALL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I felt</span> very drowsy, as if suddenly awakened from
a deep sleep. The story of the murder of Jayeng
Rono was still ringing in my ears; the cunning leer
of the Chinese was present to my mind’s eye; but
<i>where</i> was I?—afloat or ashore?—or—and I shuddered
at the thought—once more in that terrible nest-cavern?—or
could I be really awake? No—it must
be nightmare. If so, a turn over upon my side—for
I was lying upon my back—would be sufficient. Well,
I did turn—ay, over and over again—and that proved
I was not asleep in the sampan; but it proved another
disagreeable fact—namely, that I was stark naked,
and rolling upon a dry, sandy earth. Then the
thought flashed through my brain that I had been
hocused—as it is termed in New York police-courts—by
the Chinese rogue; that the mangosteen of which
we had partaken with so much relish must have been
steeped in some narcotic plant. But my brother—where
was he? On that head, however, I was soon
set at ease; for, coming to, I suppose, almost at the
same moment as myself, he cried out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“Claud, old fellow!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, Martin.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven, you are here somewhere,” he replied;
“but where the deuce are we? It is very dark—I
can’t see. Is it to-day, to-morrow, or yesterday?”</p>

<p>“To-day, I think; but I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Then which end—night or morning?”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know; but I should say morning.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I have it,” he added, quickly; “we have been
half-poisoned by that rascally Chinese. Hang the
thief! he has come in for a pretty thing, our boat,
rifles, and game.”</p>

<p>“Then he hasn’t stripped <i>you</i> of your clothes, Martin?”</p>

<p>“Ah! but he has, though, the rogue!—only I
thought of my rifle and game first.”</p>

<p>“Come, Martin,” said I, “there is one consolation;
there seems to have been neither mosquitoes nor
white ants about, since we have been here.”</p>

<p>“Bother! but I don’t know that—every here and
there I feel as if I had been drilled. When the light
comes, perhaps we shall find ourselves as full of small
holes as a couple of colanders; but give me your hand—that
is, if you can tell where I am, by my voice.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I said; and, for a few minutes, we
played a game of blind-man’s-buff, and at length only
succeeded in meeting, by both tumbling over the same
tree-stump. Then we took hold of each other’s hand,
and sat awaiting the first streak of daylight.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t I like to come across Master Si-Ling?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
I tell you what, Claud, I could even now forgive the
fellow if he would only bring us our clothes; for what
a couple of fools we shall look to the first person we
meet, and how Prabu and the men will laugh at us,
for being so easily gulled!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know: they ought not to laugh at us,
for we shall at least look the picture of innocence.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I have it, old fellow—I tell you what we
will do.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We’ll just rig ourselves out with palm-leaves.”</p>

<p>“A very good notion, Martin,” said I; and as soon
as it became light enough we gathered some; and,
by dint of much perseverance and a little ingenuity—such
as using a piece of sharp stone for a knife, the
fibers of rattans for strings, and a thin piece of cane
for a needle, or rather piercer—we managed to encase
our bodies in palm-leaves. Then, each taking one
leaf as a head-covering, we set out, barefooted, for the
river, which, as the ground we stood upon was very
high, we could see at a distance of little more than a
quarter of a mile; and the hearty laughs we had at
each other’s appearance almost made us forget, if not
forgive, the Chinese rogue for the trick he had played
us.</p>

<p>Still, our position was not by any means enviable:
for we were obliged to keep along the river-banks,
with the chances of a tiger suddenly springing from
the jungle on one side, or a crocodile from the other,
without arms for our defense, and without shoes to
protect our feet and aid our running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Truly,” said Martin, “we should make a couple
of nice morsels for the breakfast of any tiger or crocodile
out for an early stroll; but I don’t care half so
much about that, as the laugh they will have at us on
board the prahu.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us make the best of it, Martin; for, at
least, we shall have a <i>palmy</i> time of it before we reach
the prahu.”</p>

<p>“Have done, Claud—don’t pun. Don’t you know
it has been said, that a man who will make a pun will
pick a pocket?”</p>

<p>“He would be a clever man who could pick ours
now, Martin,” said I. “But see, yonder is the carcase
of the crocodile.”</p>

<p>“This is lucky, for we can’t be a great distance from
the mouth of the river. But, look you—yonder is a
better sight,” he added, pointing to a bend of the
river, around which a man was paddling a sampan
at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, old boy!” I cried; for it was Kati, on his
return from the town.</p>

<p>“I don’t cry hurrah, Claud, for I feel as if I should
like to shrink into my shoes.”</p>

<p>“The Chinese has prevented any such feat, Martin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother, Claud! but how shall we make him
see us, for he is looking neither to the right nor to
the left?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be easy enough; but, first, let us
put our heads through the leaves, or he will never
recognize us,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Then we put our heads through so that the leaves
fell over our shoulders like capes, but of a very
odd fashion; and, as Kati pulled nearer, shouted to
him. At the sound of our voices he looked around,
but (as he afterwards related) taking us for a couple
of those forest-demons, which, from his childhood, he
had been taught to believe in, he gave a kind of shriek
of surprise, and plied his oars the faster.</p>

<p>“Bother! what a fool he is to take us for wild
beasts!”</p>

<p>“Wild beasts don’t walk on their hind legs, Martin.
No—he takes us for forest-demons,” said I, now
really fearing that he would leave us where we were.</p>

<p>“I will jump into the river, and, if it pleases the
crocodiles, will swim to him,” cried Martin.</p>

<p>“No, no—for heaven’s sake, no!” I cried, seizing
his arm—“you shall not; the river swarms with man-eaters.
At least, let us try stones first;” and at once
I hurled at the boatman a stone, which hit him on the
back.</p>

<p>Now, no greater insult could have been offered to
one of his race: thus, forgetting his fear of demons,
he turned the prow of his boat, and, leaping ashore,
creese in hand, prepared to run “a muck”; but, as he
came near, we tore the leaves from our shoulders. He
stopped suddenly, as if shot, or petrified.</p>

<p>“What demons,” he cried, “have taken the form of
the young sahibs?”</p>

<p>“I told you he would take us for spirits, Martin,”
said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“No, no,” replied my brother, approaching him, as
he shrunk backwards in no dissembled terror; “we
are no demons, but real, right-down flesh and blood,
though packed in palm-leaves.”</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit protect His slave, but it is the
sahibs!” he exclaimed, affectionately, not embracing,
but smelling us both.</p>

<p>“Yes, Kati, we are the sahibs, there is no doubt
about it,” said Martin; “and if you will not laugh at
us for a couple of simpletons, I will tell you how it
happens that we are here, like masquerading ourang-outangs”;
and then he related our adventure with the
professed story-teller, to which Kati, having listened
attentively, replied:</p>

<p>“That Chinese is a dog, and the son of a dog! The
sahibs could not help themselves, for he had mixed
with the mangosteen the Kachubong.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>“Come, Claud, that’s refreshing; for, of course, it
was no more our fault than if we had been stabbed in
the dark, or shot at by some sneak from behind a
tree,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“The sahib is right, but if catchee long-tailed dog,
he rob no man more,” replied Kati, savagely, fingering
the handle of his creese; and then he completely restored
us, or at least my brother, to good humor, by
telling us that it was a trick commonly practiced upon
the natives by the Chinese, illustrating it by an adventure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
that one of his shipmates had met with about
a year before.</p>

<p>This man, being upon a journey up one of the rivers,
was accosted by a Chinese from the bank, who requested
a passage, for which he tendered a fare and
a share of his food. The sailor received him, and ate
heartily of the viands, which, being mixed with the
datura, induced stupor and heavy sleep; and when he
awoke, he found himself lying stark naked in a forest,
fifteen miles distant from the place where he had
taken in the Chinese, robbed of his canoe and all his
property.</p>

<p>As I have said, the tide was with us; we were not,
therefore, long in reaching the prahu, on board of
which we were most heartily welcomed by Prabu, who
embraced us after the European fashion. Indeed, so
disconsolate had he been at our absence, and so delighted
was he at seeing us safe again on board, that
he had but few words to say of the rogue of a Chinese,
or our loss of game and arms. As for our wild shipmates,
they crowded around to listen to our story, and
having heard it, flourished their creeses as savagely
as if the Chinese had been before them; all of which
so pleased my brother, that I can only describe it, at
the risk of being thought vulgar, in his own words:</p>

<p>“These fellows, Claud, are ‘jolly bricks.’ Hang
me, if one of them has laughed at us! But, by Jingo,
the fellows at our school would have chaffed us not a
little, if we, after nutting in the woods, had shown
ourselves in such a precious costume.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“Ay, Martin; but then our schoolfellows were <i>civilized</i>,
and these men are only savages!”</p>

<p>“Why, Claud, do you mean to say that the more
civilized we are, the more prone are we to laugh at
the misfortunes of our fellows?”</p>

<p>“Yes; some of the best jokes are made out of the
real or fancied (it matters not which to the butt)
miseries of others, while savages are always serious,
either to friends or to enemies.”</p>

<p>“Claud, old fellow, you are a cynic.”</p>

<p>“That is better than being a wit, or witling, at the
expense of the feelings of others.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know, perhaps you are right—I am
not so wise an old fellow as you; but see, Prabu is
beckoning us to his cabin.”</p>

<p>Our captain had a meal ready, the best he could
have made up, consisting of hot rice, dried fish, a fish-sauce,
and slices of pork, to say nothing of a cup
of hot rice-spirit, of which he insisted we should partake
before saying another word—which good things
made Martin bold enough to say:</p>

<p>“Now, Prabu, I don’t like half-confidence, and you
know we shall be in a pretty mess if the Dutch happen
to catch us; besides, we are all rowing in one
boat, or prahu, which is the same thing. Do, therefore,
like a good old Prabu as you are, tell us upon
what errand you sent Kati up to that town with the
very hard name?”</p>

<p>“Sahib,” replied Prabu, in measured tones, “I may
tell you, Kati went to tell the Chief of Pugar our adventure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
with the Dutch ships, that he might be on his
guard, knowing that the suspicions of the Government
had become excited.”</p>

<p>“New conspiracies!—I thought so,” said Martin,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Not so, sahib, but a part of the old one,” replied
Prabu, astutely.</p>

<p>“But, anyhow, you will manage to get us hanged,
drawn, and quartered, or something equally pleasant,
if we don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“Will the sahib go ashore at Pugar? From thence
it will not be difficult to get back to Batavia, to Mynheer’s
house, if he wills it; nay, he shall have two of
the best of the prahu’s men as guides,” replied Prabu,
but this time with a serio-comic manner, that showed
he understood my brother to be bantering him; but
Martin, now in turn most serious, answered:</p>

<p>“Do you mean that Pugar is the end of your voyage?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not half-way.”</p>

<p>“Then look you, Prabu, as I won’t do anything by
halves, I will just go the whole length with you, for
‘one may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.’”</p>

<p>“A bad proverb, and one that encourages the weak
in vice, Master Martin,” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother, you old wiseacre! But, Prabu,” he
added, addressing our companion, “just lend us a
couple of guns, and we will soon replace the game
lost by our simplicity and the rogue of a Chinese.”</p>

<p>“Sahib Martin,” he replied, “it is not possible; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
have a good wind now, and shall lose it by staying
here longer.”</p>

<p>So, after all our adventures in search of fresh food,
we had to continue our voyage with but one pig:
however, that was better than none.</p>

<p>Upon our reaching Pugar, the last province to the
east of Java, we anchored at the mouth of the river,
while Prabu, taking with him a couple of boats, and
several chests and casks of arms, proceeded into the
interior to have an interview with, and take fresh instructions
from, the Pangeran, his master. During
his absence, which lasted eight days, Martin and I
amused ourselves by going ashore and killing small
game; for Prabu had given us two muskets—he possessed
neither rifles nor fowling-pieces. When he returned
to the prahu, he appeared in excellent spirits,
and admitted us into his confidence so far as to tell
us that he was charged with a mission to the Rajah
of Blilling, a large sovereignty in the island of Bali,
to whom, upon certain conditions, he was to deliver
arms, although what those conditions were he would
<i>not</i> tell us.</p>

<p>We had a good, brisk wind nearly all along the
coast, but as we entered the straits which cut off the
island of Bali from Java, we fell in with a dead calm,
which would have been monotonous indeed but for
Prabu, who would for hours sit and interest us with
many particulars about the island.</p>

<p>“What religion are the Balinese?” asked Martin,
upon one of these occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“Hindoo, of the sect of Siva.”</p>

<p>“Then, like the people of Western India, they are
divided into castes.”</p>

<p>“Yes—four—the Priesthood, Soldiery, Merchants,
and Servants, called <i>Brahmana</i>, <i>Satriya</i>, <i>Wisiya</i>, and
<i>Sudra</i>.”</p>

<p>“What was the supposed origin of these castes, can
you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Yes—the god Brahma produced the <i>Brahmana</i>
from his mouth, which means wisdom; the <i>Satriya</i>
from his chest, which imports strength; the <i>Wisiya</i>
from his abdomen, which implies that it is his business
to furnish subsistence to society; and the <i>Sudra</i>
from his feet, which implies that he is destined to obedience
and servitude.”</p>

<p>“Have they always been Hindoos?”</p>

<p>“No, sahib—the religion of Siva was introduced
into Bali about four hundred years ago; before that
the prevailing religion was Buddhism. A few years
previous to the Mahomedan conversion of the Javanese,
there arrived in Java a number of Brahmins, of
the sect of Siva, who received protection from
Browisoyo, the last Hindoo sovereign of Mojopahit,
a kingdom of Java, whose sea-bed was washed by the
Straits of Madura; but the latter kingdom being overthrown,
the Brahmins fled to Bali, under their leader
Wahu Bahu, and there disseminated their doctrines.”</p>

<p>“But, Prabu,” I interposed, “is it not curious that
the Mahomedans—having, by their usual means, converted
the whole of Java and the adjacent islands to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the faith of your prophet—should have permitted the
Balinese to continue the terrible worship of Siva?”</p>

<p>“‘What is written <i>is</i> written.’ The time for their
conversion had not, perhaps, come; then the refugees
were fierce and determined, and the shores of Bali are
inaccessible to conquerors, for they have neither harbors
nor even anchoring-ground.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call the religion of Siva terrible,
Claud?” asked my brother.</p>

<p>“Because it is a superstition of horrors—one that
enjoins everything that is terrible—blood and destruction.
It is the reverse of Christianity, even as black
is to white; ay, and of Buddhism, which, pagan as it
is, yet teaches only that which is innocent and simple.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>

<small>ADVENTURES IN BALI.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> fully experienced the difficulty a hostile army
might have in effecting a landing upon the shores of
Bali; for we were a full week prowling along the
coast, with all our eyes open, ere we discovered a
good anchorage, and then it was up a creek or inlet
to the westward. True, we landed in the dominions
of the Rajah or King of Blilling, but it was in the remotest
part, and a district under the rule of an almost
independent chief. Going ashore, the natives, who
were of more savage aspect and manner than I had
expected to see in Bali, flourished their creeses and
spears in our faces, demanding who and what we
were; but when Prabu told them he was an envoy
from the Pangeran of Pugar to the Rajah of Bali,
and desired to pass through that territory, they became
suddenly as submissive as slaves, and begged
he would follow them to their chief—a request with
which he gladly complied, Martin and I following.</p>

<p>They conducted us to the palace, which consisted of
several buildings, erected upon terraces called <i>pandapas</i>;
each of these were four-sided, with a thatched
roof, and supported by four wooden pillars, around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
which was a movable hoarding of bamboos. To one
of these we were introduced, where we found a ferocious-looking
little savage, in the undress of his race,
smoking a large pipe, and in earnest converse with a
younger but equally ferocious-looking personage,
whom we afterwards discovered to be his son.</p>

<p>“How, dogs,” exclaimed the senior, “is this that
you bring a stranger to this presence without our
bidding?”</p>

<p>“The lives of his slaves,” replied the chief of our
guides, trembling, “are at the great lord’s disposal;
but the noble stranger is an ambassador to his Highness
the Rajah. It may please our dread Prince to
question him.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what words are these?” cried the senior,
playing with his creese.</p>

<p>“Thy servant, O great chief and warrior,” replied
Prabu, “has a mission to his Highness the Rajah of
Blilling, from the Pangeran of Pugar; he therefore
craves help and aid to reach the royal city and palace,
for it is only upon your lordship’s territory he has
been able to find a landing-place.”</p>

<p>At the name of their royal master the chiefs bent
their heads low, and the senior desired Prabu to be
seated by his side. For several minutes they conversed
together in low tones, and although we could
not hear their words, we had little doubt of their importance;
for the whole time the Chief kept playing
with the handle of his creese, and rolling his savage
eyes about terribly. When, however, it was concluded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
he ordered his slaves to conduct us to the
largest of the pandapas, which was to be at our service
during our sojourn in his territory. Moreover, he
invited us to a banquet in the evening.</p>

<p>“Why, Prabu,” said Martin, when we were alone
in the pandapa, “by what magic words did you manage
so easily to tame that savage old gentleman?”</p>

<p>“By inspiring him with a hope, or probability, that
the rule of the Dutch in the Archipelago, or at least
in Java and its dependencies, was approaching its
end.”</p>

<p>“More conspiring! By Jingo, it is too bad! We
must look after our heads, Claud.”</p>

<p>“But what <i>especial</i> cause has this chief for hating
the Hollanders?” I asked.</p>

<p>“One that will never be forgotten or forgiven,
while any of his race remain to avenge it. But listen:
His father, who was chief or prince—for he held the
latter title—of this same district, having offended his
suzerain the Rajah, had to fly for his life; and this
he did, with his princess and attendants, to a Dutch
frigate then cruising in the straits. Now, the captain—knowing
the policy of his Government was ever to
foment the rebellion of the principal vassals against
their princes—received them on board with courtesy.
Unfortunately, however, forgetting the fastidiousness
of Orientals in all matters connected with their
women, he welcomed the princess, after the fashion of
his own countrymen, by kissing her neck. Alarmed
at such—to her—strange proceeding, the lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
screamed aloud; whereupon her husband, believing
that an insult had been intentionally offered to his
wife, rushed upon the commander and stabbed him to
the heart, while, at the same time, his followers commenced
‘a muck’ among the crew. The Europeans,
however, after a hard fight, put the prince and his people
to death, and sent the head of the former to the
rajah from whose anger he had fled.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Martin, “the Dutch may have committed
a great number of unpardonable sins in Java;
but in that case they were decidedly in the right, and
the savage only met with his deserts.”</p>

<p>“God is great!—<i>who knows?</i>” returned Prabu; for
he would upon no occasion admit the Dutch to be in
the right. “What is written is written,” he added.
“It will have a good ending, for it has raised an unquenchable
thirst for vengeance in the hearts of a
powerful tribe.”</p>

<p>But, I have said, we were invited to a banquet.
Well, it consisted of fish, fruits, sweetmeats, and a
spirit distilled from rice, of which, toward the latter
part, the chiefs partook plentifully—a rare occurrence
with the generally abstemious islanders; but,
then, our host had become greatly excited, as we shall
hereafter see, at the cause of Prabu’s visit. The most
entertaining portion, however, to Martin and I was
the performances of the dancing-girls. The remainder
of the viands having been removed, there entered the
large hall some twelve very pretty but oddly-attired
girls; each wore a plumed head-dress, glittering with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
spangles and gold—pendants of the same metal,
which reached to the shoulders—jeweled necklaces—a
jacket richly embroidered with the precious metal,
beneath which was a waistcoat of the same material—loose
trousers of cloth of gold, well bespangled,
fastened at the waist by a broad golden girdle, and
at the knees by a cord, from which hung golden bells,
that tinkled at every movement. Their arms and legs
were uncovered, with the exception of adornments of
gold, such as bracelets, anklets, and leglets. Then each
girl was armed with a richly-mounted sword, and carried
a fan with bells attached.</p>

<p>As they entered the hall, they sang the glories of
their master, keeping time upon a small drum or tom-tom;
but approaching his seat, they fell upon their
knees, and saluted him by joining their hands and lifting
up their heads; then they began to dance, with
one knee upon the ground, gracefully bending their
arms and bodies. After this, they danced upright,
keeping time with their drums; then they would place
their hands upon their swords, or pretend to be taking
aim with a bow; and they went through many other
pretty movements, which so interested us that we regretted
when the entertainment was concluded.</p>

<p>“In their love of dancing,” writes Crawford, “the
Indian islanders outvie the French. It is a passion
with them, and not only adopted as an amusement,
but mingled with the more serious affairs of life; but
their dancing is not like that of the savages of America,
nor that practiced in Western India. Like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
latter, they have professed dancing-women, who exhibit
for hire, but, unlike them, they occasionally
dance themselves; and in public processions, and even
more serious occasions, dancing forms a portion of
the solemnities.</p>

<p>“As for the style of it, as in all Asiatic countries,
it is grave, stately, and slow; it is not the legs, but
the body, and especially the arms down to the very
fingers, that are employed: dexterity, agility, or liveliness
are never attempted. To the gravity and
solemnity natural to the inhabitants of a warm climate,
any display of agility would seem as indecorous
as their stately and sluggish minuet-dancing appears
insupportably tiresome to the more volatile and lively
tempers of Europeans.</p>

<p>“The dancing of the Indian islanders may be considered
as of three kinds: their serious dances on public
occasions, the private dances of individuals at festivities,
and the exhibitions of professed dancers. Of
the first kind are the war-dances: if a warrior throws
out a defiance to his enemy, it is done in a dance, in
which he brandishes his spear and creese, pronouncing
an emphatic challenge; if a native of the same country
runs a muck, ten to one but he braves death in a
dancing posture. When they swear eternal hatred to
their enemies, or fidelity to their friends, the solemnity
is accompanied by a dance; all orders executed in the
presence of a Javanese monarch, on public occasions,
are accompanied by a dance; when a message is to
be conveyed to the royal ear, the messenger advances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
with a solemn dance, and retreats in the same way.
The ambassadors from one native prince in Java to
another follow the same course, when coming into
and retiring from the presence of the sovereign to
whom they are deputed. At fights between the buffalo
and tiger, when the persons whose business it is
to let the latter loose from its cage have performed
their duty, and received the royal nod to retire (an
occasion, one would think, when dancing might be
omitted), they do so in a slow dance and solemn strut,
with some risk of being devoured by the tiger in the
midst of their performances.</p>

<p>“Previous to the introduction of the Mahomedan
religion, it appears to have been the custom among
all the Oriental islanders, for men of rank to dance
at their public festivities, when heated with wine.
This exhibition appears to have been a kind of war-dance;
the performer drew his creese, and went
through all the evolutions of a mock fight. At present
the practice is most common among the Javanese,
with every chief of whom dancing, far from being
considered scandalous, as among the people of Western
India, is held to be a necessary accomplishment.
Respectable women never join in it, and with that sex
dancing is confined to those whose profession it is.
In the most crowded circle of strangers, a Javanese
chief will exhibit in the mazes of the dance with an
ordinary dancing-girl.</p>

<p>“The professed dancers differ little, but in inferiority
of skill, from the common dancing-girls of Hindostan:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
those who have been often disgusted with the
latter will find still less to interest them in the former.
The music to which the dancing is performed is indeed,
generally, incomparably better than that of
Western India, although the vocal part of it is equally
harsh and dissonant: now and then a single voice of
great tenderness and melody may be found, but
whenever an effort is made at raising it for the accommodation
of an audience, it becomes harsh and unmusical.
The songs sung on such occasions are often
nothing more than unpremeditated effusions; but
among the Javanese, to whom I am now more particularly
alluding, there are some national ballads that
might bear a comparison with the boasted odes of the
Persian minstrels.”</p>

<p>“Why, Prabu, man, what ails thee?—what makes
you look so savage?” said I, as, towards the middle of
the next day, the captain returned to us, after having
paid a morning visit to the palace.</p>

<p>“The Chief has gone mad: he has summoned his
principal men to a council of war, to solemnly declare
his vengeance against the Dutch.”</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Martin, “how can <i>you</i> complain,
my friend, when you incited him, by intimating that
his suzerain, the Rajah, had already joined the conspiracy?”</p>

<p>“But this demonstration will be premature. Should
it become known in Batavia, it will ruin all; a great
blow has to be struck, but in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Well, Prabu, I wish no harm to you, but, honestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
and candidly, I <i>do</i> wish I was out of this matter
altogether,” said Martin—adding: “I don’t mind
fair, open fighting, but blows in the dark are only
dealt by cowards.”</p>

<p>“The Sahib Martin,” he replied, “is prudent; he
shall have his desire when we reach the mainland;
but this savage Macassar!”</p>

<p>“Macassar!” I exclaimed. “Why, Prabu, he is a
Balinese chief.”</p>

<p>“He was born in Bali, sahib, but he is descended
from a prince of Macassar, who, upon the conquest
of that country by the Hollanders, fled with the whole
of his tribe, and, by the permission of the then Rajah
of Blilling, settled upon this coast and became governor
and chief of the district. But listen,” added
Prabu, as we heard the sound of drums and brass instruments;
“the chief and his principal officers are
about to take the oaths. Will the sahibs go with me?”</p>

<p>“Of course, we will see the whole play out, if you
will permit us,” said my brother; and then we went
to one of the oddest sights I have ever seen, either
before that time or since. I will describe it as briefly
as possible:—</p>

<p>Some fifty or sixty sub-chiefs, or leaders of divisions,
were assembled near the palace in full war-costume,
each having around his brow a white fillet—the
symbol of hostility: at their head stood the grand
chief, and his son Mahomed. At a signal from the
former, a huge banner was unfurled; this having been
sprinkled with blood, the Chief dipped his creese in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
a vessel of water and then drank of the liquid; after
this he began to dance around the banner with wild,
fantastic motions, brandishing all the while his bare
weapon, as if about to plunge it into the breast of an
enemy; then coming to a standstill, and holding his
creese upwards, he proclaimed war and eternal hatred
against their oppressors, the Dutch. “And witness,
ye men of Bali,” he concluded; “should I violate this
oath, I pray that this, my favorite and beloved creese,
may prove more injurious to me than to my foe—that
my head may be cut off and left upon the field of battle,
and that my heart may be devoured by the enemy.”</p>

<p>The ceremony being thus opened, a ring was
formed, in which, one by one, the chiefs performed
an extraordinary series of dumb motions—a kind of
foreshadowing of all they intended to do to the enemy.
The following description, however, of the performances
of one will answer for all:—</p>

<p>“A chief rushes into the ring with a wild shriek
and a ferocious look, with creese in one hand and
spear in the other; he traverses the ground, leaping
from one side of the ring to the other, and, in a
menacing posture, bids defiance to some fancied
enemy; then he stamps his feet upon the ground and
shakes his head, distorts his features, and makes his
teeth chatter again; then he throws his lance, and with
his creese hacks and hews at the airy enemy, shrieking
all the time. At length, nearly tired out, he flies
to the middle of the ring, where, seeming to have his
foe at his mercy, with two or three desperate cuts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
off goes the imaginary head of the imaginary enemy,
and he withdraws triumphantly and amidst the
plaudits of his comrades.”</p>

<p>“It’s really very funny,” said my brother, in his
usual flippant way.</p>

<p>“Hush, Martin! The Chief is going to speak,”
said I, with great difficulty preventing a laugh.</p>

<p>The Chief then—having first bestowed a little particularly
strong abuse upon the Hollanders—turning
to Prabu, said:</p>

<p>“Observe, O thou servant of the great and patriotic
Pangeran of Pugar, and ambassador to our royal master
the Rajah of Blilling—I am prepared to live and
die with you; I am as a spear in your hands, ready to
do execution in whatever quarter directed.”</p>

<p>“Observe,” cried the son, “I shall be in your hands
like a skein of white thread, ready to assume whatever
color the skill of the dyer may please to give it;” and
so they continued, one after the other, till Prabu, had
he not known their natures, might have believed himself
at the head of an army of conquerors.</p>

<p>This comedy being finished, all present were invited
to a banquet at the Chief’s house, and then followed
a tragic scene of a very revolting nature; but, inasmuch
as it exemplifies the manners and customs of
these wild people, I must relate it. The dishes having
been emptied and removed, and the dancing-girls having
concluded their performances, the Chief arose and
addressed a priest:</p>

<p>“My elder brother,” said he, “last night I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
a dream, in which the whole of the accursed Dutch
appeared to me in the shape of women. Tell me, I
pray thee, its interpretation?”</p>

<p>“My lord,” replied the priest, “the dream is good;
for women imply prosperity, and your expedition will
have a fortunate termination.”</p>

<p>“It is good—now let my brother drink deep,” said
the Chief; “for numerous shall be the baskets full
of heads the Dutch Governor shall receive, but this
time those of friends instead of enemies.”</p>

<p>And then commenced a scene which beggars description.
With every fresh draught, they boasted
more and more of their prowess; then, when there was
scarcely one amongst them who could have stood upon
his legs had he tried, thousands and thousands
of Hollanders were slain with tongue and gesticulations;
but the Chief exceeded them all in swagger,
and, as liars are said sometimes to believe their own
lies by the frequency of telling them, so he began to
believe himself a demi-god.</p>

<p>“Who among my people,” he cried, frantically,
“will dare say there is a Dutch sword, or bullet, that
can harm their lord?”</p>

<p>“Our great Chief is invulnerable!” all present
cried.</p>

<p>“It is so, my brethren—you have spoken rightly.
Behold!” The whole company arose with cries of
alarm, but it was too late. The savage, intoxicated to
madness by enmity and wine, had tested his invulnerability
by thrusting his creese into his breast: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
result was a failure, for he had fallen dead. But let
me draw a veil over the tragic scene, merely informing
my readers that such acts are not uncommon
among those wild races. As a rule, temperate and
abstemious to a degree, when intoxicated they become—as,
indeed, do all people in a greater or lesser
degree—maniacs.</p>

<p>Very cruel are the customs of the Macassars, or
people of Celebes, from whom this chief was descended.
When an enemy falls dead, or wounded,
the victor strikes off his head, and, placing it on the
point of a spear, bears it away in triumph. “This,
however,” says Crawford, “is far from being the utmost
length to which they proceed, for on some occasions
they actually go so far as to devour the heart
of an enemy, either to gratify revenge or aggravate
their usual ferocity. This practice is by no means unfrequent,
and there is hardly a warrior of note who,
at some period or other, has not partaken of this horrid
repast. I saw several who had done so, and one
person coolly observed, that it did not differ in taste
from the offal of a goat or buffalo; but another, less
hardened, assured me that he did not sleep for three
nights after his meal, so haunted was his imagination
at the thought of what he had done.”</p>

<p>The Javanese, however, when their hostile passions
are aroused, are not less ferocious than their neighbors.
In the last great war in Java, Mangkunâgoro,
having gained an advantage over the Dutch and the
Susunan, announced his success to his coadjutor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
Mankubumi, by letter, transmitting to him at the same
time <i>the ears</i> of the enemy killed or taken in action.
The latter prince, having read the letter, applauded
the chief for the victory he had gained and for the
ears he had transmitted, which he forthwith directed
to be sliced, and stewed along with the flesh of buffaloes,
and with spices. This mixture he gave to his
people, directing them to eat it with rice; he did this,
he said, because his followers were not present in the
fight, and had not obtained the ears of an enemy in
battle, and that, by thus partaking of them as food,
they might not be put to shame because they were absent
from the fight: he wished to inspire his army
with the same feelings as if they had been actually
engaged. The people ate, one and all, and bowed in
respectful silence.</p>

<p>But whatever we may think of the savages, what
can be said in defense of the <i>civilized</i> Hollanders,
who not only, as we have seen on another occasion,
remained quiet spectators of the horrors perpetrated
amongst the contending princes, but were themselves
in the habit of receiving basketfuls of their enemies’
heads as valuable gifts! Imagine, O my reader, an
American official keeping such a diary as the following,
which is a literal transcript:—</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday, January 29th.</i>—In the morning the
Boni interpreter came to the castle, accompanied by
a messenger from Datu Baringang, who presented to
his Excellency, in a basket, four enemies’ heads, said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
to be the heads of Kraing Borisala and of three
galarangs” (a rajah and three inferior chiefs).</p>

<p>“<i>Friday, 30th.</i>—Five heads more were brought to
his Excellency this morning, reported to be those of
some chiefs of the enemy, taken prisoners in the action
at Tikere yesterday, when they were defeated,
and pursued, with the loss of fifty men, by Arung
Panchana.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br>

<small>WE VISIT THE CAPITAL OF BLILLING, AND WITNESS
SOME WIDOW-BURNING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tragic end of the late Chief delayed us more
than a week, for, as a matter of courtesy, we were
obliged to remain till after the funeral. As, however,
like his ancestors, he had died a Mahomedan, his obsequies—very
different from others we were shortly
to witness—were performed, after the manner of that
religion, without ostentation. About the eighth day,
when the new Chief considered it decent to admit
strangers to his presence, he sent for Prabu.</p>

<p>“O servant of the patriot Pangeran,” he said, “it
is thy most earnest desire to proceed to the palace of
our royal master, the Rajah?”</p>

<p>“It is the command of my master, and if I live I
must obey,” replied Prabu.</p>

<p>“Know then,” said the Chief, “it is the duty of the
vassal to notify to his prince the death of his predecessor
and his own accession: for this purpose, two
of my principal chiefs proceed in my state-prahu with
presents to the Rajah. Wilt thou accompany them?”</p>

<p>“Generous and gracious is thy offer, O Chief, and
many are the thanks of thy servant,” replied Prabu;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
and so the next morning, horses being brought to our
lodgings, we—at least all but Kati—had mounted and
were about to set forth for the river, which led to
the capital of the Rajah’s dominions, when Kati, after
looking at his steed for a minute, drew his creese, and
rolled his eyes about very fiercely.</p>

<p>“Great Heaven! Martin—Prabu,” I cried, “he is
about running a muck;” and such, I believe, was his
intention, had not his captain commanded him to
sheath his weapon and declare his grievance.</p>

<p>“The dog—the son of a burnt mother!” he exclaimed
(pointing to the slave who had brought the
horses), “has sought to make me eat dirt—he has
given me a lamed mare;” at which great cause of passion,
Martin and I laughed. Not so, however, Prabu,
who at once reprimanded the slave, and ordered him
to bring another horse; for, as we then for the first
time discovered, no greater disgrace can be offered
to a man than a <i>mare</i> for a steed.</p>

<p>This little difficulty being got over, we rode forward
through the jungle until we reached the river,
where we found a prahu, and the two chiefs on board
ready to receive us, which they did in a very friendly
manner. This vessel, although not built, like ours,
for long voyages, was large enough to hold, if necessary,
nearly a hundred persons, and arranged into
various rooms—in fact, a kind of floating house, in
which the chief, attended by his retinue and the
ladies of his household, could take their pleasure for
days together. As for the two chiefs, men of very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
different ages, they were companionable, pleasant personages
enough, except when speaking of the Dutch,
then they were ferocious. Indeed, the eldest was one
of the many natives of the island we had met, who
chronicled a vendetta in his heart against their European
conquerors.</p>

<p>It appeared that his father, a principal chief of one
of the eastern provinces, having risen in arms against
the Dutch, and being defeated and slain, he and an
only brother, to whom he was passionately attached,
had been sold as slaves to one of the merchants of
Batavia. The merchant continuing, over a series of
years, to treat the two youths very cruelly, one of
them, the brother, had in a moment of desperation
slain his master: for this crime he was condemned to
death, and his brother compelled to stand by and witness
the execution. It must have been a terrible sight,
as indeed it must be a lasting disgrace to a nation,
both European and Christian, who could have inflicted
such a punishment. But let my readers judge
for themselves by the very words of a Dutchman,
who, having witnessed one of these executions, thus
records it:—</p>

<p>“The punishments inflicted at Batavia are excessively
severe, <i>especially such as fall upon the natives</i>.
I saw an execution of this kind of a slave who had
murdered his master, which was done in the following
manner: The criminal was led in the morning
to the place of execution, being a grass-plot, and laid
upon his stomach, held by four men. The executioner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
made a transverse incision at the lower part of the
body; he then introduced the sharp point of the
spike, which was about six feet long and made of polished
iron, into the wound, so that it passed between
the backbone and the skin. Two men drove it forcibly
upwards along the spine, while the executioner held
the end and gave it a proper direction, till it came
out of the neck and shoulders. The lower end was
then put into a wooden post and riveted fast, and the
sufferer was lifted up thus impaled, and the post
stuck in the ground. At the top of the post, about
ten feet from the ground, there was a kind of little
bench, upon which the body rested.</p>

<p>“The insensibility or fortitude of the wretched man
was incredible. He did not utter the least complaint,
except when the spike was riveted into the pillar;
the hammering and shaking occasioned by it seemed
to be intolerable to him, and he then bellowed out
with pain, and likewise, once again, when he was
lifted up and set in the ground. He sat in this dreadful
situation till death put an end to his torments,
which, fortunately, happened the next day, about three
o’clock in the afternoon. He owed this <i>speedy</i> termination
of his misery to a light shower of rain, which
continued for about an hour, and he gave up the
ghost half-an-hour afterwards.</p>

<p>“There have been instances, at Batavia, of criminals
who have been impaled in the dry season, and have
remained alive for <i>eight</i> or <i>nine</i> days without any food
or drink, which is prevented being given them by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
guard, who is stationed at the place of execution for
that purpose. One of the surgeons of the city assured
me that none of the parts immediately necessary to
life are injured by impalement, which makes the punishment
the more cruel and intolerable, but that as
soon as any water gets into the wound it mortifies, and
occasions gangrene—which directly attacks the more
noble parts, and brings on death almost immediately.”</p>

<p>Speaking again of the slave, the same writer continues:—</p>

<p>“This miserable sufferer continually complained of
insufferable thirst, which is peculiarly incident to this
terrible punishment. The criminals are exposed during
the whole day to the burning rays of the sun, and
are unceasingly tormented by numerous stinging insects.
I went to see him again about three hours
before he died, and found him conversing with the
bystanders. This he did with great composure; yet
an instant afterwards he burst out in the bitterest complaints
of unquenchable thirst, and raved for drink,
while no one was allowed to alleviate, by a single drop
of water, the excruciating torments he underwent.”</p>

<p>These are the kind of punishments meted out to a
subjected race by a <i>Christian</i> people—a people, too,
who have themselves known the lash, the stake, the
thumb-screw, and the thousand other devilish inventions
of torture adopted by the Governors of the tyrant
Philip, in the Low Countries, to suppress mental and
political freedom. One would have thought that their
own great sufferings would have taught them forbearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
to others, but no! Scarcely had they burst
their own bonds, than, voyaging to the East, their
insatiate thirst for gold rendered them willing slaves
to the strong, as in China and Japan—tyrants to the
weak, as in the Archipelago. Taking advantage of
the simple islanders, who received them with the
warmest hospitality, they commenced a series of small
conquests; but finding themselves called upon to exercise
the functions of sovereigns and politicians, these
rapacious adventurers—too weak and incompetent to
undertake a conquest upon a grand scale, and by
which it is possible the natives then, settled under so
many petty despots, might have been benefited—had
recourse to a policy of subtlety and intrigue, the consequence
of which has been continued wars, waste of
human life, and a mutual hatred between them and
the natives, to the ruin and destruction of the islands,
and the great misery of their inhabitants.</p>

<p>Equally blamable are the Dutch in having neglected
to teach their Asiatic subjects the full value of their
native soil and climate, and for their shortsighted
policy in keeping from them a knowledge of American
machinery, by means of which labor would have been
made a hundred times more productive, and the people
prosperous. This is especially exemplified, as we
shall now see, in the present state of the cotton manufactures
in these islands.</p>

<p>For the greater part of our journey, we found the
banks upon both sides of the river covered with dense
jungle: here and there, however, there were extensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
tracts of cleared land, upon which hundreds of women
were busily engaged.</p>

<p>“A glorious country for lazy men!—for it is only
the women who labor in the fields,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Aye, they are picking cotton,” replied Prabu; and
afterwards we learned that Bali was famous for its
production of cloth, and that the labors of the loom,
and the whole operation which the raw material
undergoes, from the moment it is brought from the
field until it is fit for apparel, is performed by women
only. It is not very gallant, truly, but then it only
shows a rude state of society; for such was originally
the case among the great nations of Asia—the Arabians,
Persians, Hindoos, and Chinese, although, ages
since, they have passed that era in the art. Then their
process of weaving is so rude and unskilful, and consequently
so expensive, that it is scarcely too much to
say, that Nature’s rich gift of a soil to produce the
raw material seems wasted upon them. But, as I have
said, the shortsighted, avaricious Dutch are to blame
for this, for they might have introduced the American
processes, by which they would have no less enriched
themselves than the natives. Picture to yourself, my
reader, such a substitute for calico-printing as is described
below, in a country over which Europeans
have ruled for nearly two centuries and a half!—</p>

<p>Of calico-printing the Javanese are entirely ignorant,
but they have a singular substitute. The part
not intended to be colored, or that which forms the
ground in a web of cloth, they daub over with melted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
wax. The cloth thus treated is thrown into the dyeing-vat,
and the interstices take the color of the pattern;
if a second or third color is to be added, the
operation is to be repeated on the ground preserved
by the first application of wax—more wax is applied,
and the cloth is once, or oftener, consigned to the
vat. The greater refinement attempted, the more certain
seems to be the failure. Moreover, this awkward
substitute for printing costs 100 per cent., at least, on
the price of the cloth; but notwithstanding the unskilful
manufacturing industry of the Javanese, it generally
excels that of the other islanders. The natives
of Celebes and the people of Bali are the only tribes
besides that may be called considerable manufacturers
of cloth.</p>

<p>But to return to my narrative. Upon reaching the
capital, we were visited by a <i>Bopartis</i>, or governor.
This dignitary ordered us to remain on board until he
had reported our arrival, and its purport, to the Rajah.
That same night, however, he returned to the prahu,
with orders from the Rajah to conduct us to his own
house, within the <i>Karaton</i>, until his highness should
be pleased to grant Prabu an audience. But a few
words about these buildings, for they are amongst the
most notable of the antiquities of Java and the immediately
adjacent islands.</p>

<p>These Karatons (residences of princes) are, in fact,
walled cities;—the palace occupying the center of the
town, and being surrounded on all sides by the habitations
of the attendants, retainers, and followers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
of the prince and the members of his family. The
empty spaces are occupied by the prince’s gardens,
and by tanks and ponds. The area is intersected by
an endless labyrinth of walls, the whole being concealed,
at any considerable distance, by a profusion
of ornamental and fruit trees. The great approach
to the Karaton is to the north, and through a square
or court of considerable extent, called the <i>alun-alun</i>,
a constant appendage of every Javanese palace. It is
in this open space that the sovereigns, once in eight
days, in conformity to Oriental usage, show themselves
to their subjects. Here all tournaments are exhibited;
all public processions are formed; and here
the retainers of the nobles wait, while the chiefs themselves
pay their respects to the sovereign. A row of
Indian fig-trees adorns the sides of the square; and in
the center, each surrounded by a wall, are to be invariably
seen two great trees of the same kind, the
space between which is that allotted for public executions.
These trees, by the way, are considered almost
sacred, and may be looked upon as remnants of
Buddhism; for the Indian fig-tree is consecrated by
the followers of that sect. Wherever they are found,
even in the most desolate parts of the country, we
are able to trace the palace or dwelling of some ancient
chief or prince.</p>

<p>After passing through the great square, we arrive
at the <i>Paseban</i>, a place shaded by a canopy, supported
on pillars, and intended to afford temporary
accommodation to the nobility while they await to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
be summoned into the presence. From the <i>Paseban</i>,
a spacious flight of steps brings us to the <i>Sitingil</i>, a
handsome terrace, in the center of which is one of the
usual <i>Pandrapa</i>. It is here the sovereign seats himself
at all public festivals—occasions when a degree
of barbaric magnificence is displayed, that approaches
to those dreams of Eastern grandeur which the minds
of Europeans imbibe from books, but which are soon
dissipated by an experience of the tameness of the
reality. From the <i>Sitingil</i> the visitor descends by another
stair, parallel to that by which he has entered,
and, by a variety of winding passages, is conveyed
through a series of gates and brought in succession to
the different palaces of the prince, each dignified by
pompous epithets, drawn from the copiousness of an
exuberant language.</p>

<p>Well, it was in a spacious residence belonging to
the Bopartis, in the Karaton, that we found ourselves
comfortably lodged and awaiting the promised audience.
Upon the morning of the third day, as Prabu,
my brother and I were squatting upon our mats partaking
the morning meal, we were aroused by the
most terrible discord—howling of women and men.
Martin and I ran to the veranda: the open space
before the house was filled with people—not a stationary
crowd, but a moving throng, all groaning,
shrieking, and screaming as they passed along.</p>

<p>“What on earth is the meaning of all this?” said I.</p>

<p>“Whose chimney is on fire? you mean, Claud. I’ll
be bound it is not anything much more terrible,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Martin, with a laugh, which, by the way, was
forced; for afterwards he confessed that he had
some notion of a rebellion and general massacre—no
very uncommon occurrence in the East.</p>

<p>“God is great!” exclaimed Prabu; “some sudden
calamity has happened,” and he left the house to
inquire. We followed, and coming up to a bevy of
men and women, shrieking, crying, beating their
breasts and tearing their hair, asked them the reason
of the noise.</p>

<p>“Siva hath visited the city with vengeance for its
sins! Our mother is called away.”</p>

<p>“<i>Their mother!</i>” said the incorrigible Martin to
me. “The old lady must have had a large family!”
But Prabu, overhearing the words, said, quite seriously:</p>

<p>“Truly, sahib, she had a large family; nearly the
whole people of Bali were her children, and to them
she was a good mother.”</p>

<p>“What mean you?” I asked; “that the Queen is
dead?”</p>

<p>“Alas! sahib, it is so: the good and heroic Ratu
Wandan Savi died suddenly during the night.”</p>

<p>“And so spoiled our breakfast,” replied Martin.</p>

<p>“Shame, brother! Speak not thus flippantly of so
serious a matter,” said I, angrily.</p>

<p>“Why surely, old Claud, you wouldn’t have me, a
Christian, go howling and shrieking about the streets,
like a half-tamed wild beast, for the death of a person
I never saw! You might as well expect me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
go into mourning for a Queen of the Cannibal Islands.
But,” he added, seriously, “Prabu, tell us who
and what was this Queen, whom you call both good
and great?”</p>

<p>“Towards the latter part of his reign, the late
Rajah, being at war with the Prince of Gelgel, suffered
a great defeat; and notwithstanding the bravery
of his son, the present Rajah, who commanded the
army, would have lost his dominions, for the Gelgel
Rajah had already invaded them; but his niece, the
Ratu, then a princess, presented herself before the
troops accoutered as a warrior, spoke of the bravery of
her ancestors, harangued them, distributed gifts, and
put herself at their head. This reviving their courage
and spirits, the soldiers fought like lions, and succeeded
in destroying the invading army and taking
the Prince of Gelgel and his family prisoners.”</p>

<p>“A plucky girl that!” said Martin—“a kind of
Balinese Joan-of-Arc. Of course the Rajah married
her; I would if I had been he.”</p>

<p>“The Rajah married her to his son, Sahib Martin,”
said Prabu.</p>

<p>“A very proper promotion, too! I hope he deserved
her.”</p>

<p>“He did: she has ever since been his chief wife and
queen.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s something, certainly; but if I had been
the princess, I should have expected, after all I had
done, to have been his <i>only</i> one. But, anyhow, it is a
good story, if only for being the first I have heard in
which the Dutch are not mixed up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“But <i>they were</i>, sahib,” said Prabu. “It was the
Hollanders who incited the Prince of Gelgel to war
against the Rajah of Blilling.”</p>

<p>“Well,” cried Martin, at random—for he was, as
it were, caught in his own trap—“thank Heaven, <i>I</i>
am no Dutchman!”</p>

<p>“Allah be praised you are not!—for then Prabu
could not have befriended thee, even at thy utmost
need,” replied our companion. “But, sahibs,” he
added, “the good Queen’s death happening at this
time is especially unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“Why more at this time than any other?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because, sahib, the Rajah will grant no audience
until after the funeral, and that cannot, according to
custom, take place in less than one month and seven
days.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Martin; “a pretty time to be
cooped up here! How shall we pass our time?”</p>

<p>“Take to the woods or the river, and employ ourselves
with our guns,” I suggested; and so we did, day
by day, but for all that the time hung heavily upon
our hands. As for Kati, Prabu sent him back to the
prahu; for, for some reason unknown to us, he had no
great faith in the honesty of the young chief Mahomed.</p>

<p>A few mornings after this, as my brother and I, accompanied
by Prabu, were passing through the principal
street on our way to the jungle, we encountered
a procession that somewhat startled us—at least Martin
and me. It consisted of twenty litters, in each
of which sat a young woman attired in white, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
accompanied by an aged attendant of the same sex.
The appearance of the two was contrasted; for
whereas the girls looked as joyful as if going to a
wedding, the old ladies looked as dismal as if they
were attending a funeral. There was also a band of
musicians in the rear, playing a very lively air.</p>

<p>“Strange,” I remarked, “that such doings should
be permitted at a time of public mourning!”</p>

<p>“Sahib, these women are the chief mourners for the
late Queen: they were her slaves, devoted to her
through life—they will accompany her in death. Yesterday,
the whole of the Queen’s women sought the
Rajah, and earnestly, and in tears, besought his permission
to accompany their mistress to the next
world: from among the applicants his Highness selected
these.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” I exclaimed, with a shudder; “I had forgotten
they are Hindoos.”</p>

<p>Of course my reader has heard of suttee or widow-burning,
so long practiced in our Indian Empire, but
now, to a great extent, suppressed by the English
Government. Well, that inhuman rite has never prevailed
on the continent of India to the same extent as
among the islanders, amongst whom, indeed, it is supposed
to have had its origin.</p>

<p>When a prince or princess of the royal family dies,
their women or slaves walk around the body, uttering
cries and frightful howlings, and all begging to die
for their master or mistress. The Rajah, on the following
day, designates, one by one, those of whom he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
makes choice for the <i>privilege</i>, as had been the case
with the twenty poor creatures in that procession.
From that moment to the last of their lives, they are
daily conducted, at an early hour, without the town,
to perform their devotions, having their feet wrapped
in white linen; for it is no more permitted to them to
touch the bare earth, because they are considered as
consecrated. The old women who accompany them
are for the purpose of fanning the flame of their enthusiasm,
and to keep them from wavering as the
hour of death draws nigh. The night before the day
of execution these poor creatures are made to pass in
continual dancing and rejoicing, without being permitted
to close an eye. All pains are taken to give
them whatever tends to the gratification of their
senses, and from the quantity of wine which they take,
few objects are capable of terrifying their imaginations.
Besides, their minds are inflamed by the promises
of their priests, and their mistaken notions of the
joys of another state of existence. How strongly this
reminds one of the Aztec festival, in honor of Tezcatlipoca
(the Mexican Jupiter), only in the latter the
ghastly mockery of state and happiness was kept up
by the victim for twelve months before he was butchered
upon the sacrificial stone, to be afterwards served
up, with the rarest of condiments, at the tables of the
priests and nobles!</p>

<p>But if, day after day, for the prescribed period of
mourning, we were shocked at this procession, now
that we knew its intent, how shall I describe our feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
at witnessing the sacrifices! But my readers
shall judge for themselves. About noon, on the day
appointed for the funeral, the procession started from
the palace. First came the twenty doomed girls, in the
order according to their rank in the deceased’s household,
each in an elegantly-constructed <i>badi</i> or litter,
bedecked with flowers, and followed by an aged
woman, who would, from time to time, endeavor to
fan the perhaps now dying flames of enthusiasm;—then,
priests, bearing roasted viands, rice, and betelnut,
as offerings to the gods, followed by musicians,
playing triumphant tunes. So they moved onward,
until they arrived at the place of sacrifice. Here there
were twenty scaffolds, in the form of troughs, each
raised upon four poles, and edged in on two sides with
planks. The victims having arrived, they were thrice
carried round a circle. After this, the sufferers were
placed in troughs, which was the signal for the approach
of a man and a woman to each: the former,
snatching the flowers which bedecked the girls, held
them above their heads with pieces of the offerings to
the gods, which the women posted behind them
snatched from their hands and threw upon the ground.
Then a priest let loose a pigeon, <i>as an emblem that
their victims’ souls were on the point of taking their
flight to the mansions of the blessed</i>! At this moment
there was a solemn and mournful silence; but amongst
the victims, not a lip quivered, not a muscle moved;
but you could see the bosoms heaving beneath the
white robes, and, I fancied, could hear the beating of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
their hearts. There were wet eyes, and sobs, too; but
it was from their relations in the crowd, whose natural
affections could not be entirely subdued, even by these
dire superstitions.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at a signal from the chief priest, four
powerful men ran up to one of the victims, and divested
her of all her garments but the sash; then two
seized her arms, the other two her feet, so as to extend
her form to its full length: a fifth drew his poignard.
Simultaneously, the same terrible tragedy was being
performed upon the other nineteen. But let me get
over the sad story, made sadder by the mistaken
heroism of these poor girls. During all this, none
had their eyes covered. Some few, seeing the butcher
draw forth his poignard, demanded it; receiving it in
the right hand and passing it into the left, they respectfully
kissed the weapon; then, having wounded
their left arms, they sucked the blood, stained their
lips with it, and made a point with the blood upon
their foreheads. Then returning the daggers to their
executioners, the latter stabbed them to the heart, and
they died without a complaint escaping them. At this
moment I felt my arm clutched convulsively—a slight
shriek. Turning round, I saw that my brave, joyous
brother Martin had fainted with horror.</p>

<p>“Water, water!—for heaven’s sake, water, Prabu,”
I exclaimed; but there was no necessity for such a
call. The people, the bystanders, who could look so
cruelly, coolly upon that terrible scene, flocked around
him, and, with the kindness of innocent natives, aided
in restoring him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Claud, Claud,” he cried, coming to, “this is too
sickly, too horrible! Let us go;” and, nearly as much
overcome as himself, I led him away.</p>

<p>From hearsay, therefore, will I describe the rest of
that horrible rite—even more horrible than those of the
Aztecs; for among the latter the sacrifices were performed
by priests, but in Bali by common executioners,
who receive as a reward fifty pieces of copper
money each.</p>

<p>After the death of the victims, their nearest relations
present came forward, washed the bodies, and
covered them with perfumed wood, in such a manner
that the head alone remained visible. They were then
placed upon the funeral pile and consumed to ashes.</p>

<p>About this time the body of the Queen—which, by
the way, from a superstitious notion that it will cheat
the devil (whom they believe lies in wait in the ordinary
passage), had been brought from the palace
through an aperture especially made in the wall—arrived
at the funeral pyre. It was borne upon a superb
<i>badi</i>, or litter, of a pyramidal form, consisting of eleven
steps, and supported by a number of persons, proportioned
to the rank of the deceased. At each side
of the body were seated two women—one holding an
umbrella, and the other a flapper of horsehair, to
drive away insects. Two priests preceded the badi, in
vehicles of a particular form, holding each in one
hand a cord attached to the badi (as if giving to
understand that they were leading the deceased to
heaven), and ringing with the other a little bell;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
while such a noise of gongs, tabors, flutes, and other
instruments was made, that the whole ceremony had
less the air of a funeral procession than of a joyous
village festival.</p>

<p>When the body had passed the funeral piles arranged
in its route, it was placed upon its own, which
was forthwith lighted, while the chair and couch
used by the deceased in her lifetime were also burned.
The assistants then regaled themselves with a feast,
while the musicians, without cessation, struck the ear
with a tumultuous melody, not unpleasing. This festivity
continued till evening, when, the bodies being
consumed, the relatives returned to their homes, leaving
a guard for the protection of the bones—those of
the Queen only, for the rest were gathered up and
thrown away.</p>

<p>The next day the bones of the Queen were carried
back to her former habitation, with a ceremony equal
in pomp to that of the preceding day; there they remained
for a month and seven days. Each day a
number of men proceeded to the palace, with vessels
of silver, brass, and earth, filled with water, and accompanied
by a band of musicians and pikemen.
There were also other attendants, carrying green
boughs, the mirror, the vest, betel-box, and other domestic
articles belonging to the deceased. Every
day during the above period the bones were devoutly
washed, after which, being placed in a litter, they
were conveyed (accompanied by a similar retinue to
that which had attended the corpse in its first removal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
from the palace) to a place called <i>Labee</i>, where they
were entirely burned, and the ashes, being carefully
collected in urns, were cast into the sea.</p>

<p>By the law of Bali, no woman or slave is <i>obliged</i> to
follow this barbarous custom; yet even those who
have desired to submit to it and have not been accepted,
as well as those who have not offered themselves,
are alike shut up for the remainder of their
lives in a convent, without being permitted the sight
of a man. If any one should find means to escape
from her prison, and is afterwards taken, her fate is
instantly decided; she is poignarded, dragged through
the streets, and her body cast to the dogs to be devoured—the
most ignominious form of inflicting death
in that country. That, however, these unfortunate
women do sometimes escape is evinced by the following
anecdote, given by a Dutchman, who was sent as
ambassador from the Governor-General of Batavia
to the sovereign of Bali:—</p>

<p>“On the death of the reigning king, the whole of
his wives and concubines, sometimes to the number
of a hundred or a hundred and fifty, devote themselves
to the flames. None of them are previously
poignarded, a distinction confined to this occasion.
As they are at such a time permitted to walk without
restraint, it happened, at the funeral of the late King
of Bali, that one of his women, as she was preparing
to follow the example of her companions, lost her
courage at the sight of the dreadful preparations.
She had sufficient presence of mind, in approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the bridge, to ask leave to withdraw for a moment on
some common pretext, which being granted without
any suspicion, she betook herself to flight with all
possible speed. The <i>singularity</i> of the circumstance,
rather than any motive of compassion, saved her life,
and gave her her freedom. Afterwards, she was seen
daily at the public market selling provisions; and although
she was regarded by all persons of rank with
the utmost contempt, she heeded neither looks nor
words.</p>

<p>“Another object of contempt among the Balinese,
and for a reason sufficiently singular, is the female
slave to whose lot it falls to wash the dead body of
her mistress, during the month and seven days before
the funeral rites. It is, in fact, for the performance
of this task that her life is saved, and liberty afterwards
given to her to retire where she pleases into
the country to earn her livelihood.”</p>

<p>The same writer gives us the following interesting
account of the self-immolation of the princesses
of the blood-royal:—</p>

<p>“At the funeral of the king’s two sons, who died
a short time before, forty-two women of the one,
and thirty-four of the other, were poignarded and
burnt in the manner above described; but on such
occasions, the princesses of royal blood leap themselves
at once into the flames, as did at this particular time
the principal wives of the princes in question, because
they would look upon themselves as dishonored
by any one laying hands on their persons. For this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
purpose, a kind of bridge is erected over the burning
pile, which they mount, holding in their hands a paper
close to their foreheads, and having their robe tucked
up under their arms. As soon as they feel the heat,
they precipitate themselves into the burning pit, which
is surrounded by a palisade of cocoa-nut stems: in
case their firmness should abandon them at the appalling
sight, a brother, or other near relative, is at
hand to push them in, and render them, out of affection,
that cruel office.</p>

<p>“We were informed that the first wife of the
younger of the two princes just alluded to, who was
daughter to the king’s sister, asked her father, who
was Prince of Couta, whether, as she was but three
months married, and on account of her extreme
youth, she ought to devote herself on the funeral
pile of her deceased husband? Her father, less alive
to the voice of nature than to the prejudices of his
nation, represented to her so strongly the disgrace
she would, by preferring to live, bring upon herself
and all her family, that the unfortunate young
woman, summoning all her courage, gaily leapt into
the flames, which were already devouring the dead
body of her husband.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br>

<small>WE RETURN TO THE COAST, AND HEAR OF AN OLD
ENEMY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of the Queen brought about a sad disappointment
to Prabu, for, the day after those terrible
rites, the Rajah caused it to be given out that
he would give no audiences, nor, indeed, transact any
kind of business, for the ensuing six months: nevertheless,
he bore it with his usual coolness.</p>

<p>“God is great!” he said. “‘What is written <i>is</i>
written.’ The Rajah is suffering under a great misfortune,
and we must wait his Highness’s pleasure.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed my brother. “Wait six months
in this city of horror, with the ghosts of those poor
murdered girls haunting us?—not I!”</p>

<p>“The Sahib Martin is as impatient as he is brave;
but I shall not wait in this city. <i>No</i>—we will return
to the coast with the Prince Mahomed’s ambassadors.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, we set out upon our return voyage
at early dawn on the following day, and reached
Mahomed’s domain without any incident worthy of
record. We purposed to go on board the prahu the
day after our arrival, but upon paying a farewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
visit to the prince, so earnestly and kindly did he importune
Prabu to remain his guest for a week or so,
and so desirous was the latter of securing for his
party as enthusiastic an ally in the son as he had had in
the father, that he consented.</p>

<p>As for Martin, he was delighted at the arrangement;
“for Claud,” said he, “in a few days the heavy
rains will fall, the tigers will be driven down from
the mountains, and we shall have a chance of some
good sport.”</p>

<p>“Martin,” replied I, “it would be better for us if
we were safe on board the prahu. I don’t believe in
this young prince or chief, whichever he may be.
His father was an unmitigated savage, but he was
honest; the son’s manners are so velvety, that, depend
upon it, he means no good.”</p>

<p>“What! You are at your witch-practices again,
are you? Nonsense, old fellow; the truth is, you don’t
half like tiger-hunting; I do, though, for it is plucky
sport.”</p>

<p>“Plucky! Well, Martin, I don’t think so. Where
is the pluck in, say, six, seven, or a dozen men, with
as many sets of brains (any one being of superior
quality to the tiger’s), the same number of long
knives and rifles, which deal out death at a great
distance, attacking one poor beast with no other
weapons than its paws: an animal, too, possessing so
little courage—notwithstanding all that tiger-hunters,
to enhance their own deeds, say about it—that, like
a cat or rat, it will seldom face a cool and determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
pursuer if it can run away, without, indeed, it be
goaded to madness by a bullet or so?”</p>

<p>“I grant you, Claud, that the tiger is a coward;
for, instead of boldly facing its prey like the lion, it
sneaks about the jungle, ready to fall upon the first
unwary pedestrian or animal that may pass.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as a cat upon a mouse; but, like the cat, the
tiger, if boldly faced and pursued by an animal,
would run away; and, surely, there is small courage
in conquering a flying enemy!”</p>

<p>“Then you mean to say there is no pluck in a man
fighting a tiger?”</p>

<p>“In <i>one</i> man fighting <i>one</i> tiger, perhaps; but even
then it requires more skill and practice with a particular
weapon than courage; for what chance has
the beast against a double-barreled rifle, in hands
trained to its use? But it is of your ordinary tiger-hunting
I speak disparagingly—I mean as it is practiced
upon the continent of India by the vainglorious
Englishmen, who, on their return home, write books
about it to glorify their own courage.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I hope we may have a choice of
joining one of these hunts, Claud,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Possibly so; and I, of course, shall accompany
you; but it will not alter my opinion, that the chances
are not equal between the hunter and the hunted.
Why, what does a celebrated writer say of tiger-hunting
in India?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know, nor do I care,” he replied,
a little sulkily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“Then I will tell you, if only to put a word in for
the poor animal. He says: ‘It is little better than
killing cats; nor are there so many risks attending
it as in foxhunting. The sportsmen—and there are
generally twenty of them, with twice that number of
elephants, encaged in the howdahs, each having half
a dozen loaded double-barreled rifles, charged as fast
by servants as they can be fired—are perched in the
same security as if in a tree, deer-shooting. A mahout
sometimes gets a scratch, but it is the noble elephant
that bears the brunt of the battle, and everything
depends on his sagacity, courage, and steadiness.
If the elephant won’t stand, becomes frightened,
and goes off, then, indeed, the sportsman’s life
is in some jeopardy; but this seldom happens, and
even then the number and arms of the party are out
of all proportion to the strength of a tiger or two.’”</p>

<p>“Oh! bother, Claud, I wish you hadn’t such a
good memory. But what has tiger-hunting in India
to do with me—we are on the island of Bali?”</p>

<p>“Well, my position is even more strengthened by
the practice in Java,” said I, which Martin knew;
but as my readers may not, I will tell them how the
Javanese hunt the tiger, that they may judge what
chance the poor beast has in the contest:—</p>

<p>A vast circle of spearmen is formed around the
known haunt of a tiger, which is gradually contracted,
until the animal, hemmed in on all sides, is
compelled to attempt an escape by rushing through
the phalanx. In this endeavor he is commonly killed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
through the number and dexterity of the hunters, and
the formidable length of their weapons. “Among a
great many exhibitions of this sort,” says an old resident
in Java, “to which I have been witness, I never
knew an instance in which the tiger was not destroyed
without the least difficulty.”</p>

<p>The same writer gives us another proof of the disadvantage
at which the tiger is taken:—“Among the
Javanese, the most interesting animal-fight is that between
the tiger and the buffalo. The buffalo of the
Indian islands is an animal of great size and strength,
and of no contemptible courage; for he is an overmatch
for the royal tiger, hardly ever failing to come
off victorious in the fight with him. It must be confessed
that there is no small satisfaction in seeing this
peaceful and docile animal destroy his ferocious and
savage enemy. Neither is possessed of much active
courage; the tiger, indeed, is a coward, and fights
only perfidiously, or through necessity. On this account,
it is necessary to confine them within very narrow
limits, and, further, to goad them by various contrivances.
A strong cage, of a circular form, about
ten feet in diameter and fifteen feet high, partly covered
at the top, is for this purpose constructed, by
driving stakes into the ground, which are secured
by being interwoven with bamboo: the buffalo is then
introduced, and the tiger let in afterwards from an
aperature. The first rencounter is usually tremendous:
the buffalo is the assailant, and his attempt is to crush
his antagonist to death against the strong walls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
the cage, in which he frequently succeeds. The tiger,
soon convinced of the superior strength of his antagonist,
endeavors to avoid him, and when he cannot
do so, springs insidiously upon his head and neck.</p>

<p>“In a combat of this nature which I witnessed, the
buffalo, at the very first effort, broke his antagonist’s
ribs against the cage, and he dropped down dead;
the buffalo is not always so fortunate. I have seen
a powerful tiger hold him down, thrown upon his
knees, for many seconds; and, in a few instances, he
is so torn with wounds that he must be withdrawn,
and a fresh one introduced; in nineteen cases out of
twenty, however, the buffalo is the victor. After the
first onset, there is little satisfaction in the combat;
for the animals, having experienced each other’s
strength and ferocity, are reluctant to engage, and
the practices used to goad them to a renewal of the
fight are abominable. The tiger is roused by firebrands
and boiling water, and the buffalo by pouring
upon his hide a potent infusion of capsicum, and by
the application of a most poisonous nettle (<i>lamadu</i>),
a single touch of which would throw the strongest
human frame into a fever.”</p>

<p>But I am digressing.</p>

<p>Now, although, as I have intimated, I had some
suspicion that the young chief had no honest intentions
toward us, I had no other reason than a certain
forced courtesy and kindness of manner, which
seemed unnatural, or at least out of place, in a nature
so wild and ferocious. Yes, there was one other—viz.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> 
a certain cunning expression about his eyes and
upon his lips, that I did not like. My suspicion, however,
became confirmed, that at least there was something
wrong somewhere, when I accompanied my
brother and Prabu down to the prahu.</p>

<p>“How is this?” said Prabu to Kati, as we went
on board—“lying at single anchor and the guns
shotted! What do you fear?”</p>

<p>“Kati don’t fear—he only take care. Be ready, case
what might happen,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Kati, my friend,” replied Prabu, laughing, “when
left in command, thou art over-cautious, for what harm
<i>could</i> happen to us in a friendly port?”</p>

<p>Kati’s reply to this was to the effect that, a few
days before, a Dutch grab had appeared off the coast,
and that she had sent a boat ashore with two men in
her; and that although both had landed, and, as he
believed, visited the Chief, but <i>one</i> of them had returned
to the grab. “The other,” he said, “is now in
the Chief’s house—what for is he there?”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said the captain, thoughtfully, “this may
mean evil. I will question Mahomed. But is that
your only reason for lifting one anchor and shotting
the guns?” he added.</p>

<p>“No. The day after grab go away, the Chief come
on board and admire prahu, but especially guns,
which he look at with his eyes, as much as to say,
‘Should like to have guns, ship, and all.’ Then Kati
say to himself, ‘S’pose Chief think same thing some
night, he with his men come and run muck among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
prahu’s crew, and then when Captain Prabu come
back, if not kill him and young sahibs, easy for him
to say prahu run away, or been stolen by rascal
Dutchman.’”</p>

<p>“My faithful Kati, I do not blame you,” replied
Prabu, “for having such suspicions. You have acted
bravely, but your fears are groundless. Why should
this chief make us eat dirt? Did not his father swear
eternal hatred to the Dutch, and friendship with their
enemies?”</p>

<p>“But s’pose old chief honest, dat no reason young
chief honest too—all son not like fathers. Then, if
he hated Dutch, as he said when he took oath, what
for he hab ’em in ’is house now?” he replied—adding,
quaintly enough: “The noble Captain Prabu say
Kati faithful; dat why he keep his eyes open when
his master got his shut. It no good fasten door of cage
when tiger got away.”</p>

<p>Then, determined to put a word in, as Prabu
seemed to have such a thorough conviction of the
Chief’s honesty, I said:</p>

<p>“Well, Kati, what think you of trusting ourselves
tiger-hunting with this chief?”</p>

<p>“Think it no harm at all, s’pose sahibs keep eyes
wide, wide open, and take six prahu’s men with ’em—only,”
he added, with a glance full of meaning, “to
help clear jungle; nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Bother! we shall lose the tiger-hunt after all,” exclaimed
my brother.</p>

<p>“Better that than hunt with tigers for our companions,
Martin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“The Sahib Claud’s word are not good—the Chief
is our friend,” replied Prabu, angrily. “Kati has
frightened himself by conjuring up the shadow of a
demon; but Kati, brave as a lion by himself, is all
fear when his master’s safety is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Kati fears the anger of his good master more
than the spears and creeses of a thousand Balinese
chiefs,” replied the faithful fellow.</p>

<p>“Hast thou intimated to one of the crew thy suspicions?”
asked Prabu, sternly.</p>

<p>“Is it possible the servant could breathe to slaves
that which was only for the ear of the master?” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Prabu, in kindlier tones, “Kati, my
friend, thou hast done well, and thy master is not
angered. Now, sahibs,” he added, “we will return
ashore.”</p>

<p>“Truly, Prabu,” said I, as we were walking towards
the pandapa—wherein now, as upon our previous
visit, we had our lodging—“thou art obstinate
in thy faith in this Mahomed’s honesty!”</p>

<p>“Who is Prabu, that he should doubt his friend
and ally?” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Not even,” said I, “when, at this moment—if
Kati’s story be true—he is harboring a Dutch spy in
his palace? For if this man were not a spy, why did
the Chief not tell thee of his coming to the island?”
At which Prabu became thoughtful for a minute, and
then replied:</p>

<p>“True, the sahib has <i>some</i> ground for his suspicions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
and I will ask the Chief who this man is, and
<i>why</i> he harbors him,” he replied; and he left us there
and then, to visit the palace.</p>

<p>About two hours afterwards, however, he rejoined
us, and seemingly in the best of spirits; for, unusually
with him at any time, he laughed heartily as he told
us that the Dutchman, after all, was no Dutchman—indeed,
nothing but a native soothsayer, who had obtained
a passage to the island in the Dutch grab.</p>

<p>“But the Dutch grab, what business had she on
this coast?” I asked, still doubtful whether the
captain of that vessel might not have been in communication
with the Chief to our future detriment.</p>

<p>“A trader only, who put in for wood and water.
True, her captain desired to trade for bales of the
native cloth, but the Chief dismissed him with the
plea that there was none in his territory fit for the
market. Sahib, sahib,” he added, laughing again,
“poor, faithful Kati has been frightened half out of
his life by a Dutch trader, the natural curiosity of a
young chief, and the landing in the island of a wen-necked
hunchback.”</p>

<p>“A what?”—“<i>A wen-necked hunchback!</i>” exclaimed
my brother and I simultaneously, and starting
as if stung by a venomous snake.</p>

<p>“A wen-necked hunchback,” he repeated, quite
coolly. “But why do the sahibs startle, as if a tiger
had leapt forth from my mouth?”</p>

<p>“Prabu,” said my brother, “is this hunchback a
snake-charmer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“Allah only knows!”</p>

<p>“Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“No—and if I had I could not tell, for, truly, men
do not have their occupations written upon their foreheads.”</p>

<p>“Can <i>I</i> see him?” asked my brother, knitting his
brows, and clenching his hands together till the nails
entered his skin. “Don’t laugh, Prabu, again, for I
am serious, and feel as likely to run a muck as one
of your own countrymen.”</p>

<p>“Let the Sahib Martin be patient till to-morrow,
and perhaps he may see this man about the palace
gardens,” replied Prabu. “But why dost thou so
desire to meet this poor wretch?”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied my brother, “I shall then know
whether he be the villain who robbed us of our cousin—nay,
who perhaps hath murdered her.”</p>

<p>“Pray Allah it may prove so, Sahib Martin,” replied
Prabu, also playing with the haft of his creese,
and, rarely for him except under the greatest excitement,
something of the ferocity of his race in his
eyes, “for we will tear the whole truth from his
heart.”</p>

<p>“Prabu,” cried my brother, starting from his seat,
and taking our companion by the hand, “thank you—thank
you for that speech;” then sitting down again,
he murmured, as tears ran down his cheeks—</p>

<p>“Poor dear Marie!”</p>

<p>“Poor dear young sahib!” said Prabu, deeply affected
at my brother’s anguish, “weep not, dear boy”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
(this was the first time he had used such a familiar
phrase); “for be assured, if still upon earth, we will
find her; if—” but he could not utter the word as he
caught the expression upon Martin’s face—“she shall
be avenged.”</p>

<small>THE WEN-NECKED HUNCHBACK, AND HIS REVELATIONS
TO PRABU.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> wen-necked hunchback!”</p>

<p>As at night these words had been the last upon
our lips, so were they the first in the morning.</p>

<p>“I will seek out this fellow at once,” said my
brother.</p>

<p>“But <i>how</i>, Martin? It would be to look for a
needle in a haystack; for the house and grounds of
the Chief Mahomed are well-nigh as large and intricate
as those of the Rajah’s karaton.”</p>

<p>“I will seek Mahomed himself, and beg of him to
produce the rogue.”</p>

<p>“A bold notion, truly, but not a wise one; for if,
as I suspect, he be here for Mahomed’s amusement,
or, worse, as a spy or an ally in some secret scheme,
such a demand would, in all probability, bring us a
couple of creeses between our ribs. Besides, brother
mine, we cannot be sure the fellow is he whom we
seek; for wens and hunchbacks are so plentiful in
these Indian islands, that it can be no uncommon occurrence
to find them met together upon the same person—but
here comes Prabu.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“Prabu,” said Martin, as that personage joined us,
“I am determined to see this hunchback, even if I
demand him of the Chief Mahomed.”</p>

<p>“Is the sahib tired of his life?—it would be madness,”
he replied, hastily. “But,” he added, “it is not
necessary; I have discovered where this man is lodged,
and there must we seek him.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked my brother, eagerly.</p>

<p>“In the second pandapa in the gardens, about a
hundred yards to the back of the palace.”</p>

<p>“Let us hasten,” cried Martin, snatching up his
creese from the floor.</p>

<p>“Nay, not so, sahib: we should have to eat dirt,
for he is now with the prince, with whom, for some
reason or other, he seems to have become a great
favorite. Let us rest patiently till night.”</p>

<p>With great difficulty Martin curbed his impatience
till nightfall, and then, guided by Prabu, we set out
together for the gardens; these we entered by a small
postern in the northern wall, which our guide had discovered
by bribing one of the slaves.</p>

<p>“See,” said Prabu, pointing to a low building—through
the chinks in the wooden wall of which we
could perceive the glimmer of a light—“that is the
pandapa; but tread softly, be cautious, or he will hear
our approach.”</p>

<p>We crept stealthily to the boarding and looked
through a chink.</p>

<p>“The rascal!” muttered Martin, between his teeth,
and placing his hand upon the haft of his creese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Allah preserve us! He is at his incantations,”
exclaimed Prabu.</p>

<p>But let me explain to the reader what we saw. The
place was lighted by the dirty yellow flame of an oil-lamp,
placed upon a pedestal about three feet high.
At the base of this, upon the boarded floor, squatted,
with his legs crossed beneath him, a hunchback with
a wen neck; but his face we could not see, for his
back was towards us. He was intently watching the
figure of a man wrought of wax, robed in yellow, the
royal color, and at the same time muttering some
words, in a tongue I had never heard before.</p>

<p>“The dog!” muttered Prabu. “He is seeking to
encompass the death of the Rajah by enchantment.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” I whispered.</p>

<p>Then he took, from beneath a black cloth lying near
at hand, a human bone, upon which, with a preparation
which seemed to me compounded of blood and
charcoal, he proceeded to write a name.</p>

<p>“The dog—the dog!” again muttered Prabu; “it
is the Rajah’s name.”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush, Prabu!” I whispered. “Would to
Heaven he would show his face, that we might be
sure of our man!” Almost as I spoke my wish was
granted: he arose, and turned towards us the but too
well remembered features.</p>

<p>“Enough, Claud, it is he!” exclaimed my brother;
and the next instant he had passed the threshold, and
was struggling with his old enemy.</p>

<p>“Rogue—rogue! thou shalt not escape me this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
time,” he said, as he clutched him by the neck almost
to suffocation.</p>

<p>“Remove your hands, Martin,” I cried; “you will
kill him, and then we shall learn nothing.”</p>

<p>“True,” replied Martin; but as he pulled forth his
pistol and held it to the hunchback’s head, he said:
“Nevertheless, he <i>shall</i> die, if he attempts to move
from this spot without my permission. Now, dog!
thief!” he added, “if thou wouldst live another hour,
answer three questions.”</p>

<p>“Let the sahib put them: Huc-cuk will answer, if
not forbidden by the demons,” replied the old rogue,
but with trembling limbs and chattering teeth;—at
which, indeed, there was nothing astonishing, for he
stood, as it were, in the center of a triangle composed
of two glittering creeses (Prabu’s and mine) and a
loaded rifled pistol.</p>

<p>“Is the girl whom you stole from Mynheer Ebberfeld’s
house alive and uninjured?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“As I would save my worthless life, sahib, she is
both alive and uninjured.”</p>

<p>“Good! Now tell me <i>who</i> instigated the crime?”</p>

<p>“A demon, sahib.”</p>

<p>“No trifling, thou rogue!” replied Martin, savagely.
“Don’t answer me with your demons, or I will send
thee to sup with them.”</p>

<p>“The gods forbid, sahib: it was a demon, the demon
who prompts all men to crime—poverty. Yes, Huc-cuk
was starving, and he stole the girl that he might
get bread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“That is indeed candid, thou old rogue!” cried
Martin. “Now, tell me, to whom didst thou sell her?”</p>

<p>“To some wandering merchants.”</p>

<p>“Villain,” cried Martin, “this is false; else how
knowest thou she is even now alive, unharmed, uninjured?”</p>

<p>“Sahib, the merchants who bought her again sold
her to be the handmaiden of a princess.”</p>

<p>“Now, thou rogue,” said Martin, making the lock
of his pistol click, “prepare to die, or answer me
truly: Where is she now—where may we find her?”</p>

<p>The old coward trembled like an aspen leaf, as he
replied—</p>

<p>“Let the sahib have patience, while Huc-cuk consults
the demons—for this question he may not answer
without their permission;” and then he buried his
face in his hands, and began muttering, or, rather,
making strange, unearthly noises. The result was
that in about five minutes, in bolder tones, he said:</p>

<p>“The sahib may take Huc-cuk’s worthless life; the
demons forbid his answering that question.”</p>

<p>“Enough, then—take the consequences!” cried
Martin, passionately: and he would have shot him
there and then, but Prabu dexterously jerked the pistol
in an upward direction.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, sahib, but Allah forbid that you
should rob the public executioner of his fees, for already
is this man’s life forfeited to the laws of Bali.”
Then to the hunchback he said, “Well knowest thou
this, O dog of a sorcerer and traitor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“Well does the miserable Huc-cuk know that the
noble Prabu utters words of truth,” whined the
hunchback.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the captain, evidently greatly surprised,
“then you know me?”</p>

<p>“The descendant of the illustrious patriot Surapati
is known to every native-born Javan—is it possible
it could be otherwise?”</p>

<p>“Dog!” replied he, sternly; “if thou knowest me
as <i>Prabu</i>, and as the descendant of the great Prince,
thou also knowest that I will keep my word. Thus,
if thou disclosest the whereabouts of this girl, and we
find her unhurt, unharmed, thou shalt be free to come
and to go: if not, his Highness the Rajah shall take
thee in his keeping.”</p>

<p>“The noble Prabu hath commanded—the miserable
Huc-cuk will obey; but the words must be spoken in
his ears alone, for so have the demons willed it.”</p>

<p>“Let us parley with the rogue no longer,” cried
Martin.</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied Prabu, “if the sahibs would learn
that which they so much desire to know, they must
be patient; let them therefore withdraw for a time
from the pandapa.”</p>

<p>“And leave you alone with this fellow?” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Aye,” replied Prabu, “for the dog hath more to
fear from me than I from him.”</p>

<p>“Prabu is right, we will await without.” Then,
taking Martin by the arm, he permitted me to lead
him outside the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“That fellow will escape us yet,” said my brother.</p>

<p>“Not so,” I replied—“Prabu knows how to manage
him better than either of us;” and so Martin was
compelled to await the result.</p>

<p>After a close and whispered conference of half-an-hour,
not one word of which could we catch, Prabu
came forth from the pandapa.</p>

<p>“Well, where hath the rogue hidden our cousin?”
we both asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Let the sahibs rest happy and contented—their
cousin is safe and unharmed.”</p>

<p>“But where? How can you be certain of this?”</p>

<p>“Prabu hath said it: do the sahibs doubt his
words?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” replied Martin; “yet I cannot—I cannot
feel convinced! But, anyhow, that fellow shall not
escape me until I have the assurance from his own
lips;” and so saying, he dashed up the steps and
through the doorway, but then gave such a wail of
agony and despair, that, fearing he might have been
suddenly attacked and wounded by Huc-cuk, I immediately
followed him; but there he stood, now speechless
with rage, for the hunchback had escaped.</p>

<p>“Claud, Claud!” he exclaimed, on seeing me, “even
Prabu has deceived us—but bitterly shall he pay for
it;” and as the latter came up the steps, I believe he
would have attacked him had I not held him back.</p>

<p>“Martin, my brother, for shame! Have faith in
Prabu still—he would never betray us so cruelly.”</p>

<p>“Give me, then, thou Javan dog!—give me, I say,
my cousin or this hunchback!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Javan dog in thy teeth!” exclaimed the descendant
of Surapati, savagely; then, with a smile, he
added: “But the poor young sahib Martin is mad
with grief, and forgets that, for his uncle’s sake, the
<i>Javan dog</i> is to him the most faithful of animals.”</p>

<p>“Well,” hotly replied Martin, “the words were
wrong—I retract them; I believe in you, Prabu; but—but
I insist upon knowing where our cousin is hidden.”</p>

<p>“Let the Sahib Martin have patience,” was the
quiet reply—“let him wait. Prabu, who would die
fifty deaths rather than betray or deceive the nephews
of the good Councilor Black, swears by the Koran,
that the girl shall be delivered to them safe and unharmed.
More than this he cannot, dare not, must
not <i>now</i> say! Will the sahibs trust him?”</p>

<p>“Frankly will I,” said I, shaking his hand; but
Martin stood bewildered, and as if half-ashamed of
his impetuosity, yet too proud to give in. It was,
however, but for a moment; then, following my example,
he took him by the hand, saying:</p>

<p>“Prabu, I submit; but, for Heaven’s sake, lose no
time in relieving me from this cruel suspense.”</p>

<p>“The Sahib Martin,” replied the other, “is again
himself, and the joy of having his cousin restored to
him will be sufficient recompense for his present sufferings.
But, again, let me assure him that she is safe,
for the hunchback would not have dared to deceive
Prabu.”</p>

<p>“But why should he not deceive you?—who can believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
one word from the lips of so great a rogue?”
asked Martin.</p>

<p>“There are reasons that I may not now disclose;
but one I may. Having discovered him in the very
act of sorcery, one word of mine would bring down
upon him and his whole family, no matter how wide
apart they may be, a dreadful punishment—for terrible
are the laws of Bali; and that word I promised
should never be spoken if he could <i>convince</i> me, beyond
all doubt, that the girl was safe and unharmed,
and that he did—by what means, for the present, no
matter;” and with this explanation we were compelled
to rest content, and so returned to our lodgings.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of sorcery, among those of the Indian islands
not converted to Mahomedanism, it is regarded,
as of yore in England, as the most atrocious of crimes,
and punished accordingly.</p>

<p>“If,” says the Balinese law, “a man falsely accuse
another of sorcery, and speak publicly thereof, the
magistrate shall fine him forty thousand.” “If a person
write the name of another on the winding-sheet
of a corpse, or on a dead man’s bier, or make images
of another of paste, or, writing the name of a
man on a slip of paper, suspends it on a tree, buries
it in the earth, deposits it in haunted ground, or where
two roads cross each other, any of these shall be
deemed sorcery. If a man write the name of another
on a human bone, with blood and charcoal, this also
shall be deemed an incantation. Whoever is guilty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
any of these practices shall be put to death. If the
matter be very clearly made out, let the punishment
of death be extended to his <i>father</i> and <i>mother</i>, to his
<i>children</i>, and to his <i>grandchildren</i>!—let none of them
live!—let none connected with one so guilty remain
on the face of the land, and let their goods be, in like
manner, confiscated. Should the children or parents
of the sorcerer live in a remote part of the country,
still let them be sought out and put to death; and let
their goods, if concealed, be brought forth and confiscated.”</p>

<p>This cruel custom of putting to death a whole family
for the fault of one, reminds me of a similar custom
among the Japanese, and which is sufficiently illustrated
by the following historical anecdote:—</p>

<p>In the year 1638, the governor of a small province
near Jeddo so oppressed the people, that the Tycoon
ordered that he and all his relations should have their
stomachs ripped open, as nearly as possible, at one
and the same hour. He had a brother, who lived two
hundred and forty-seven leagues from Jeddo, in the
service of the King of Fingo; an uncle, who lived in
Satsuma, twenty leagues further; a son, who served
the King of Kinocuni; a grandson, who served the
King of Massame, a hundred and ten leagues from
Jeddo; and at three hundred and eighty leagues from
Satsuma, another son, who served the governor of
the castle of Quanto; two brothers, who were of the
regiment of the Emperor’s guards; and another son,
who had married the only daughter of a rich merchant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
near Jeddo;—yet were all these persons to be
executed precisely at the same hour. To do that they
cast up what time was requisite to send the order
to the farthest place; and, having appointed the day
for the execution there, orders were sent to the Princes
of all the places I have mentioned, that they should
put to death all those persons on the same day, just at
noon, which was punctually done. The merchant who

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br>

<small>WE JOIN A TIGER-HUNT, BUT NARROWLY ESCAPE POISONING,
AND ESCAPE TO OUR ISLAND.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night the heavy rains commenced, and for
three days we were kept within doors, for in those
islands it literally “never rains but it pours”—nay,
falls in torrents, which deluge the whole land. Neither
was this seclusion rendered any the more agreeable,
now that, having been assured of our cousin’s
safety, our minds were perpetually racked with curiosity
as to her whereabouts and Prabu’s reasons for
keeping it secret from us.</p>

<p>Thus, when the rains cleared off, and the Chief
Mahomed invited us to join him and party in a tiger-hunt,
we rejoiced—I, that activity would prevent my
mind from preying upon itself—Martin, partly for
a similar reason, but chiefly, that he was about joining
in a sport of which he had heard so much, but seen
nothing. As for Prabu, he, I believe, accepted the
invitation out of mere politeness, and, perhaps, policy,
hoping thereby to secure the young Mahomed to the
interests of the “Dutch-hating party.” But, however
that might have been, he must at last have begun to
entertain some suspicions as to the Chief’s honesty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
purpose; for, upon the morning of the hunt, he sent
Martin down to the prahu, with orders to bring back
a party of six of the best of the crew, armed with muskets
and creeses.</p>

<p>Upon Martin’s arrival with the small force, the
Chief, who was standing in the midst of some ten or
twelve of his vassals, all armed with creeses and boar-spears,
looked very surlily; then, changing his tactics,
he affected to praise the appearance of the men
and their arms, but mildly suggested to Prabu that,
for the sake of himself and crew, it would be as well
to send them back to the prahu, as the sight of so many
armed men might arouse the jealous fears of the villagers
in the mountains. But Prabu, with equal simplicity
or cunning, declared that there was no fear of
their embroiling themselves with his subjects, for they
were mild-tempered men, whom he could hold well in
hand, and that, moreover, he had ordered them to accompany
the party for his Highness’s amusement and
gratification—indeed, to show him what musket-practice
would do among the tigers; adding, that, should
his Highness approve it, he would, before taking his
departure from his territory, present him with a case
of arms. At which Mahomed testified so much delight
and good humor, not to say apparent manly
frankness, that even I began to think that my suspicions
were groundless.</p>

<p>Well, all being prepared, we started, Mahomed leading
the way into the interior, by following the windings
of a small river—swollen, muddy, and rapid from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
the late heavy rains. Now, during the first five or
six hours, Mahomed was both lively and jocose: as,
however, time wore on, and we found no tiger’s
track, he became moody, and withdrew every now
and then to hold a conference with two of his sub-chiefs;
and this again arousing my doubts, I whispered
to Prabu and my brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother with your suspicions and prophecies
of evil, you old witch!” replied the latter; “he is only
sorry because we have not yet been able to beat up
a tiger.”</p>

<p>“Sahib,” replied Prabu, “there is no fear; for if
Mahomed were to play us false, he would lose the
muskets I have promised. It is as the Sahib Martin
says: you will see how his eyes will glisten when
we start a tiger.”</p>

<p>After such expressions of confidence, what could I
say?—nothing—and so we pursued our search for
game for two more hours; but then, as we had reached
a small village of bamboo huts, the Chief proposed
that we should remain in one of them and refresh ourselves,
while two of his attendants went to beat a
neighboring jungle.</p>

<p>As we entered this little village, an incident occurred
that exhibited to the full the true nature of the
Chief. A girl, very pretty for a native, ran across our
path, and, stumbling against a tree-stump, fell at his
feet. Conceiving this—albeit a pure accident—to be
an insult to his dignity, Mahomed caught her up in
one of his vise-like fists, and dashed her forward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
a considerable distance, where she lay, bruised and
bleeding from a wound in the face.</p>

<p>“The cowardly hound!” cried I, in English; and
running forward, followed by Martin, we picked her
up, staunched the bleeding, and with kind words led
her into the nearest hut, where we left her, with a
face beaming with gratitude, and exclaiming, “Allah
preserve the good sahibs!”</p>

<p>This interference—for so the Chief doubtlessly considered
it—between him and one of his slaves, evidently
much vexed him; and I could see, from the
savage glare of his eyes, that it was with pain he restrained
his anger. As soon, however, as we entered
one of the huts, the cloud seemed to have passed over;
for he began a lively chat as to our hunting prospects,
which he continued until interrupted by the coming of
the refreshments. At the very sight of these, even,
Martin and I forgot his brutality; for our vision was
then delighted with stores of the delicious mangosteen,
and our sense of smell by the arrival of several small
vessels of hot, well-milked coffee. Fortunately for
us, the refreshing beverage was not drunk.</p>

<p>But now let me tell you how we were placed in that
hut. I was reclining at full length, with my head
resting upon a bamboo pillow, against one of the sides;
the bamboos of which had shrunk from each other at
least an inch, so that, when looking in that direction,
I could see all that was doing without. My brother
was in a similar position by my side—Prabu about
the middle of the hut; and between us three and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
door, with his face turned rather toward the exterior,
sat the Chief upon a mat. This position he
had taken, ostensibly, that he might the better communicate
with his people, who, of course, were not
permitted to sit in their lord’s presence. With reference
to the men, I may add that, while the attendants
of Mahomed had seated themselves in a line immediately
near the hut, our party from the prahu were
placed at a short distance beyond them; but both parties
were partaking, or about to partake, of their coffee.</p>

<p>Well, I had been in the position described three or
four minutes, awaiting till the coffee had become sufficiently
cool to drink, when, as my left hand rested
against the bamboo, I felt a tickling sensation. Turning
my head, I saw the girl who had been so brutally
used by the Chief earnestly gazing upon me. “Sahib,”
she whispered in my ear, “not drink coffee; it kill.
Young chief bad man.”</p>

<p>The coffee was poisoned, then—there could be no
doubt as to her meaning; but how fearful were my
sensations! Martin had his cup at his very lips—there
was no time for caution. In an instant I had
snatched it from his hand, crying, “It is poisoned; we
are betrayed!”</p>

<p>The Chief sprang up like a tiger-cat; but Prabu, as
if by instinct seeing through the whole conspiracy,
dashed his own scalding coffee in Mahomed’s face.
Then, with one blow of his creese striking him to the
earth, he cried, “Forward, forward, sahibs, to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
own men;” and so astonished at this sudden muck
were the Chief’s people, that we had passed the cordon
and reached our own men, ere one of the former
could get to his feet.</p>

<p>“Those who have partaken of the coffee,” cried
Prabu, “are poisoned—we are betrayed! Give the
rogues a volley!” This order being instantly responded
to by a deafening discharge of muskets, he
added, “Now, run for your lives. Load as you go,
for there are others at hand.”</p>

<p>And away we scampered helter-skelter towards the
little river, never stopping until we had placed it between
us and our pursuers; for that they would follow
we had little doubt.</p>

<p>“By Jingo, old witch!” said Martin, as he stood
wiping the perspiration from his forehead; “you are
right again, and we have had a narrow escape.”</p>

<p>“Have the men partaken of the coffee?” I asked.</p>

<p>The answer was in the affirmative, and that many
of them had been attacked by sickness; but, thanks
to the fright and excitement, it had proved innoxious
to the system. It had not, in fact, had time to render
the circulation torpid, or, indeed, we should all
have been lost.</p>

<p>I now told Martin that we were indebted for our
lives to the little native girl.</p>

<p>“Heaven bless her, then, for this great return for
our small kindness!” he exclaimed. “But, Claud,
what cowards are we to leave her among these
wretches! Nay, even now it may not be too late. Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
us return, run a ‘muck’ among them, and bring her
off.”</p>

<p>“Very quixotic and useless, my dear brother; for
she is in no danger, as none know who cautioned us,
and, doubtless, she will keep her own counsel.”</p>

<p>“The Sahib Martin is possessed to propose such a
thing,” said Prabu; “but forward, or by another route,
one party may yet cut us off from the prahu.”</p>

<p>So onward we tramped, crossing and recrossing the
winding stream, till we had reached within two miles
of the late Chief’s town; then we dashed into the
jungle, hoping by a short cut to reach the coast, and
so perhaps, by keeping near the sea, get sight of the
prahu. It was a heavy, toilsome march through mud,
slush, and dense jungle; but at length we scented the
briny air, at another time disgusting from its impregnation
of rotten fish and foul weeds, but now the odor
was delicious to our nostrils, for it came from the sea.
Then, when, after hewing and cutting, as we dragged
our wearied limbs through a prickly jungle of rattans,
and obtained sight of the broad expanse of ocean,
each man gave one leap—literally, a leap for joy—and
fell upon the beach to rest.</p>

<p>“I would give half the fortune left to us by our
uncle, Martin, to be once more safe on board the
prahu,” said I.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, though—we are safe enough; the imps
will never find us here,” replied my brother; but even
while he was speaking, there arose a loud yelling on
the town-side of the jungle, and at once every man
was again upon his feet, musket in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>“We are lost!” I exclaimed, as the enemy, nearly
a hundred in number, came rushing towards us.</p>

<p>“We have one hope,” said Prabu; “they have no
fire-arms;” then, quick as thought, he settled upon a
plan of defense. “Give them a volley, but let each
man take a steady aim,” he cried.</p>

<p>This we did (there were nine of us in all), and with
such effect that the Balinese stood as if paralyzed at
the sight of their dead and wounded countrymen.
Then, when we had reloaded, Prabu told off my
brother, myself, and three of the crew, and, pointing
to a small, wooded island, about a quarter of a mile
out at sea, he bade us swim to it, but at the same time
to preserve our arms and ammunition, as best we
could, from the water. “Until the sahibs reach the
island,” he added, “we will keep the rogues from
sending their arrows after them.”</p>

<p>“To save our arms and ammunition,” said Martin,
“we must swim with one hand, holding the musket
and cartridge-box in the other,” and this we did; for,
like the native islanders, we had learned to swim like
fish.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the island, we saw that the Balinese,
who had by that time recovered their self-possession,
were now bearing down upon our comrades. The latter,
however, who had formed in line, with their
backs turned to the sea, let the enemy approach and
discharge a shower of arrows—which, by the way,
they received without flinching, or, indeed, harm; then
sending a volley, which told as well as the former one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
turned and, leaping into the water, made for the island.
Now came our turn: the Balinese were about
to follow our comrades into the water, but ere a foot
had been wetted, Martin and I, by way of protecting
the swimmers by a covering fire, sent a couple of
leaden messengers in their midst, that made them yell
and shout, till the very air seemed filled with their
noise. But they were quieted, as far as action against
us went, at least for the time.</p>

<p>“They have had enough of it for this day,” said
Martin.</p>

<p>“True, sahib,” said Prabu, who, with his men, had
just landed; “but at daybreak, the devils will be upon
us by hundreds.”</p>

<p>“Then won’t we give them a warm welcome, that’s
all,” replied Martin. But he added: “Sufficient for
the hour is the evil thereof; so, in the meantime, that
we may have strength and pluck enough to meet them,
let all of us but one snatch a few hours’ rest.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Prabu, “that would not be wise—a
sandbank must be thrown up for defense; the sahibs,
however, may sleep three hours, when we will awaken
them to keep watch while we sleep.”</p>

<p>“Very good, so be it,” said Martin. Then, with
the aid of two or three of the men, we cut some
branches and leaves from a large cocoa-nut tree, and
erected a temporary hut; after which, lighting a fire
at the opening, as a preventive against the foul vapors
of the morass, we loaded our rifles, placed them carefully
upon the earth, and, stretching ourselves at full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
length by their side, fell off to sleep. I must add that,
to relieve our heated and sore feet, we threw off boots
and socks.</p>

<p>Now, the toil and excitement we had undergone
seemed to have a very different effect upon me to what
it had upon my brother; for while he slept soundly, I
was restless and wakeful—that is, I suppose, I must
have had what is called a cat’s sleep. By the way,
why a cat’s sleep should be a synonym for wakefulness,
I could never understand; for since those days
I have had many cats, very fine, sensible cats, too, and
by closely watching their habits, have ever found, providing
they were properly and carefully brought up—<i>i.
e.</i>, treated kindly and well-fed—that they sleep
quite as soundly, aye, and snore and dream, too, as
well as any alderman after a corporation dinner.</p>

<p>But to return to my sleep that night: it must have
been very restless, for at a slight rustling noise, I became
wide awake, and, gently raising upon my arm,
and looking towards my brother, a cold shudder
ran through my frame; for, by the light of the
fire, I saw a great serpent crawling towards him.</p>

<p>The slightest noise would have caused the reptile
to attack him, while it was just possible that, as Martin
lay motionless, it might pass over him without
injury. “For possibly,” I thought, “it has been
aroused from a state of torpor by the heat of the fire,
which it is evidently making toward.” Thus, with
breathless anxiety, I watched it advance. It crawled
across his legs, its head was upon his naked feet—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> 
my heart seemed in my mouth. I felt inclined to
snatch up my rifle—but no. Providentially, I had sufficient
presence of mind to resist the temptation, and
in another instant it had passed out of the opening,
and I could have cried for joy. But then it occurred
to me that it might attack one of the sleepers without;
for some of our men, I knew, must by this time have
lain themselves down, for a yellow streak in the horizon
told me it could not be far from daybreak.</p>

<p>This was enough. I jumped up, and, taking my
rifle, followed the serpent. It was still gliding onwards,
but, hearing my footsteps, it erected its crest
and turned around. There was now no alternative;
in an instant the contents of my rifle were in its head.
But, simultaneously, a man sprang upwards, and then
fell heavily backwards, as if shot.</p>

<p>“Great Heaven!” I exclaimed, “I have killed a
man!”</p>

<p>Not so, however, for again he arose with a cry of
“Malik,—they are coming,” doubtlessly believing that
the Balinese had landed; and in a minute, Martin,
Prabu, and the whole of our party were by my side.</p>

<p>By way of excuse for alarming them, I pointed to
the snake, still writhing in the agonies of death.</p>

<p>“But,” exclaimed Prabu, “the sahib is frightened at
nothing—he has wasted powder and ball upon a mere
worm. Look,” he added, “this is how to kill them,”
and he stuck a boar-spear through the head of the
still writhing reptile; then, winding the body round
the handle, he tossed it to one of the men, telling him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
to roast it for the morning’s meal. Nevertheless, and
notwithstanding Prabu’s contemptuous manner and
remark—and which, as he afterwards confessed, he
only assumed, to hide his chagrin that the whole party
had been alarmed at the mere killing of a snake—the
reptile was of a species whose bite is mortal; and that,
too, my brother knew full well, for as we kept watch
that night, while the rest of the party slept, he said—</p>

<p>“Claud, dear old boy, Prabu’s out of temper—never
mind what he says; for to your wise old head,
that kept you from alarming the snake, I owe my
life.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>

<small>A FIGHT: A GREAT PERIL AND A TIMELY RESCUE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> day broke we examined our position. The island—which
had, in all probability, at some distant
period, formed a promontory of the mainland, until
cut off by the channel which now divided it from the
shore—appeared to be about three miles in length by
two in breadth. To the right, to the left, to the back
of us, the shores were belted with groves of the cocoa-nut
and gomuti palms; but the shore opposite the
mainland was sandy and bare, excepting that nearly
to the water’s edge were scattered the trunks of huge
palms—which, by the way, our commander in the
night had ingeniously converted into buttresses for the
sandbanks—or, in military parlance, “earthworks”—they
had thrown up, and which were about breast-high.</p>

<p>As the sun rose in the horizon, we saw the Balinese,
at least a hundred of them, bustling to and fro, shaking
their spears and creeses in defiance, and could hear
their yells of anticipatory triumph.</p>

<p>“They are preparing to attack us, Martin; see, they
have a couple of boats. Let us arouse Prabu,” said I.</p>

<p>“Aye, Claud, but look—they have observed us;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
down with your head,” and scarcely had he uttered
the words when a shower of arrows came flying
through the air—the greater number of which, however,
found their billets in the earthworks.</p>

<p>“Come, Martin, let us call Prabu.”</p>

<p>“No, not yet; every minute of rest is an object,
with such work as we have before us for the rest of
the day. Let us tackle them between us. But look—the
two boats have put off. Bring your rifle to
your shoulder and take a steady aim at one, while I
take the other; for it would be uncivil not to acknowledge
the receipt of the feathered messengers
they have just sent.”</p>

<p>Well, a steady and deliberate aim, and from across
the water we could hear the dull thud—thud of our
bullets, as they struck the sides of the boats.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” cried Martin, “there is a couple of
loopholes in their sides, but that is not enough.
Again, Claud, but this time an inch or two higher;”
and once more we fired. The reports of our pieces
aroused Prabu and the men, who came towards us,
shouting, “Malik, Malik!—they are coming, they are
coming!”</p>

<p>“Are they, though!” exclaimed Martin—“not a bit
of it; at least not until they have put into dock again
to stop the shot-holes in their sails and boats.” And
Prabu, at first angry that we had commenced action
without orders, no sooner saw the telling effect of our
well-directed fire, than he cried out—</p>

<p>“The sahibs are heroes—let them keep their rifles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
pointed at the boats,” and then he employed himself
in posting his little force, with their muskets, at angles
of the works; so that while we, with our long-range
rifles, harassed the enemy, Prabu and his party could,
by a cross-fire, deal out destruction to any who, after
the habit of their race, might take to the water—which,
as it was then low tide, was not more than
breast-high.</p>

<p>For a couple of hours, however, we had but little
employment, save discharging a bullet now and then
among stragglers, who from time to time ventured to
the edge of the water, for the purpose of sending an
arrow or two at any head that might chance to appear
above our sandbank. As for the two boats, they
had long since been lugged ashore, their crews not a
little scared that a bullet could be sent among them
from so great a distance; for it was, in all probability,
the first time the deadly rifle had been heard by them.</p>

<p>But the brave Balinese will get accustomed to any
weapon, however terrible at first, and so speedily the
boats were again manned, but this time their crews,
all but two rowers in each, laid themselves at the bottom;
and at the same time that they put off, some
eighty of their comrades, armed with bows, arrows,
spears, and creeses, took to the water—in order, I suppose,
to create a diversion, for the latter were equally
divided into parties and placed at each side of the
boats: thus, shrieking and yelling, they advanced toward
us.</p>

<p>As before, Martin and I kept our eyes upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
boats; but so well and gallantly did their crews
manœuvre them—keeping them for ever moving,
twisting, and whirling them about in the water—that
they became as difficult to hit as seagulls on the wing
in a tempest: we fired and fired, but all in vain. In
the meantime, Prabu and his men had stood at their
posts without firing a shot, and a well-planned
manœuvre it was; for as the yelling, screaming enemy—having
exhausted a considerable portion of their
strength by their toil in the water, and the frequent
discharge of their arrows (you must remember that
they stood breast-high in the sea)—came near the
shore, one half kept firing and the other loading, and
that with such good aim and rapidity, that in about
an hour, all who were not killed beat a retreat to the
mainland.</p>

<p>But while this had been going on, Martin and I had
been engaged keeping the boats, which, daringly
enough, had run right beneath the works, from landing
their crews: one of these we managed to scuttle
by pouring bullets into her, and her few remaining
men swam back to the opposite shore; but the other,
in spite of rifles and muskets, set her crew ashore.</p>

<p>Had they effected this an hour before, when their
comrades were finding full occupation for Prabu and
the men, we should have been hopelessly lost. But
now the latter, throwing aside their muskets and
drawing their creeses, sprang to our aid, and drove
them back to their boat—all but one, and he, Martin
and I carried a prisoner into the interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>The enemy being thus beaten back, we began to take
stock of our ammunition: the result was pitiful.</p>

<p>“Not half a dozen rounds each man,” cried I.</p>

<p>“We must reserve them for our utmost need, and
take to our creeses and the butts of our pieces,” said
Prabu.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” said Martin; “it will come to a hand-to-hand
fight soon, and then we shall be beaten by
mere numbers.”</p>

<p>“Would to heaven Kati and the prahu were near!”
I exclaimed; and I must admit that, at the prospect
before us, we became gloomy and thoughtful. My
brother, however, who was seldom at a loss for expedients,
suddenly exclaimed, as a bright thought occurred
to him:</p>

<p>“I have it! We will re-rig that scuttled boat, and
one or two of us can put out to sea in search of the
prahu.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Prabu, “and we may yet be saved;
for she must be somewhere at hand upon the coast.”</p>

<p>“I have another notion,” cried Martin; “we will
examine our prisoner.”</p>

<p>“To what purpose?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! you will see,” he replied, and we had the man
brought before us.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Martin to him, “we are going to hang
you up to one of those palm-trees.”</p>

<p>“God is great! What is written <i>is</i> written: the
sahib has his servant’s life in his hands,” replied the
man—who, like the greater portion of Mahomed’s
subjects, was a Mussulman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>“Well, that’s cool,” replied Martin; “but,” he
added, “will you honestly answer any questions I may
put to you, if we promise to save your life?”</p>

<p>“Sahib,” he replied, “a dead man is of no use to his
family.”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted my brother, laughing; “that is a
fact, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Then, by the head of the Prophet and my hopes
of Paradise, I will answer the sahib truly.”</p>

<p>“Is your rascally chief, Mahomed, dead?”</p>

<p>“Sahib, no, but severely wounded, yet not so badly
that he cannot direct the attacks upon you here.”</p>

<p>“Why did this young chief, the son of a man so
friendly to us, seek to encompass our deaths so treacherously?”</p>

<p>“Because, while the sahibs and the Captain Prabu
were in the capital, a Dutch ship came whose captain
offered him a great reward in silver, as also the prahu,
its guns and cargo, if he would deliver into his hand
a certain Captain Prabu.”</p>

<p>“But why did the Dutch want the Captain Prabu?
what harm has he done them?” asked our leader himself.</p>

<p>“Because the great Dutch chief who rules at Batavia
knows that Prabu is a descendant of the Prince
Surapati, and also that he has been sailing about the
island, and on the coast of Java, to incite the different
chiefs and princes to rebellion against the Dutch.”</p>

<p>“The dog!” exclaimed Prabu, “but how can this
be? is it possible a son can disgrace a father’s memory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
for did not the late chief hate the Dutch, and with
his son swear eternal war against them?”</p>

<p>“He did, sahib, but Mahomed loves honor and his
country less than gold and power; besides, the Dutch
governor has promised to make him Rajah of Blilling
in place of the present Prince, who he fears—nay
<i>knows</i>—is his enemy.”</p>

<p>“How <i>know</i> they this?” asked Prabu, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Mahomed has sent a messenger to the governor
of Batavia, telling him.”</p>

<p>“But where is the Dutch grab?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“At the mouth of the straits of Bali, awaiting the
return of the prahu either to receive prisoners, when
Mahomed has taken them, or to waylay the prahu in
case she should escape from Mahomed.”</p>

<p>“But the prahu, know you where she is?”</p>

<p>“Almost within gun-shot, riding at single anchor,
about two leagues from the town.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Martin, sternly, “we are going to send
the boat in search of the prahu; we will keep you here
till its return, when, if we find you have spoken falsely,
you shall be hanged like a dog.”</p>

<p>“If, oh, Sahib! thy servant hath spoken falsely, let
him die the death of a dog; but, if truly, let him live.”</p>

<p>“A bargain!” cried Martin; and so the conference
ended, to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>

<p>When, however, the boat had been made seaworthy,
there arose a dispute between my brother,
Prabu, and me, as to who should undertake the somewhat
dangerous service of seeking the prahu. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
we could only settle it by casting lots, when the duty
fell to my brother, who thereupon left the island by
the wooded side, taking with him his rifle, all the ammunition
we could spare, and some fruits.</p>

<p>The remainder of that day we patiently awaited another
attack, but it came not. The Balinese contented
themselves with keeping watch along the opposite
shores—a matter, by the way, of small consolation to
us, for it was evident they were only awaiting reinforcements
from the interior, and, in all probability,
fresh boats, and should these auxiliaries arrive before
the coming of the prahu, we were hopelessly lost.
Then, again, now that the excitement of the fighting
was past, our men lay about in all directions in a state
of exhaustion, with no other refreshment than the
fruits of the cocoanut-tree and the <i>gomuti</i> palm; indeed,
but for these two edibles, we should have died
from mere exhaustion, as between them they afforded
us both meat and drink. Apropos of the latter, it is
not only one of the most singular members of the vegetable
world in the Indian islands, but adapted to such
a variety of uses, that my readers may fairly excuse
me for giving them a description of it.</p>

<p>The gomuti (<i>Borassus gomutus</i>) is the thickest of
all the palms, but shorter than the cocoa-nut. The
fruits, which are about the size of a medlar, and of a
triangular form, grow from the shoots of fructification
on long strings of three or four feet, and that,
too, in such abundance, that the quantity depending
from a single shoot is more than a load for a man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
The fleshy outer covering affords a juice of so highly
stimulating and corrosive a nature, that, when applied
to the skin, it occasions great pain and inflammation.
Then, from the interior of the fruit, the Chinese prepare
a sweetmeat, and the Indian islanders distil a
spirit or toddy, which they use upon going into action,
and which excites them in such a degree, that the
Dutch not inappropriately denominate it <i>hell-fire</i>.
This is the principal production of the gomuti palm,
and it is extracted in the following ingenious manner:—</p>

<p>One of the shoots of fructification is, on the first
appearance of fruit, beaten for three successive days
with a small stick; the shoot is then cut off a little way
from the root, and the liquor which pours forth is received
in pots. One palm will, at the age of nine
years, yield for two years at the average of three quarts
a day. From this liquor, again, a sugar is made by
boiling it to a syrup, and is sold in all the markets.
The Chinese also use it in the composition of the celebrated
Batavian arrack.</p>

<p>Another production of great value, and which resembles
black horsehair, is found between the trunk
and branches, in a matted form, interspersed with
long, hard, woody twigs of the same color. When
freed from the latter, it is used for any purpose of
cordage. The small twigs found in the hair-like material
are used by all the tribes who write on paper as
pens, and for the manufacture of the poisoned arrows,
which are blown from tubes. Beneath this hair-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
material is found a third species, of a soft, gossamer-like
texture, which is used by the Chinese in large
quantities as oakum in calking the beams of ships,
and as tinder for kindling fires. Lastly, like the true
sago-palm, the gomuti affords a medullary matter,
from which a farina is formed, and which is used
throughout Java in considerable quantities. But to
resume my story.</p>

<p>Hour after hour having passed without bringing an
attack from the Balinese, I began to entertain some
hope that the severe loss they had already sustained
from our fire-arms, but more especially the rifles, had
so sickened them that they would make no other attempt—at
least until we had been reinforced by the
prahu. These hopes, however, were dissipated when,
at the dead of night, as I lay stretched across our
earthworks with rifle in hand, I heard a confused
noise, a splashing in the water, and saw torchlights
dancing among the trees on the banks. Having
awakened Prabu, he watched and listened for a few
minutes, and then said:</p>

<p>“They have been reinforced from the town, Sahib.
They have horsemen among them; I can hear the
trampling of their hoofs—nay, listen, that was the
neighing of a horse!”</p>

<p>“True,” I said; for I had distinctly made out the
same sound.</p>

<p>“They have <i>boats</i>, too,” he continued. “They intend
attacking us under cover of the darkness of the
night, believing thereby they will avoid our rifles and
musketry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>“Just my opinion, Prabu. I will send a bullet
among them to let them know we are prepared. If it
knocks over one or two, it may deter them from coming,
as they will have proof sufficient that the darkness
is no great protection.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Sahib, not one charge must be wasted.
They shall approach, aye, to within a dozen yards of
the shore, for you will see that each boat will hold
two or three men with torches, which will be lighted
only as they are about to land and fall among us like
so many demons.”</p>

<p>Prabu then posted the eight of us, including himself,
along the earthworks, at intervals of about a
dozen yards.</p>

<p>“Speak not a word, move not a limb, till you hear
the report of my piece; then, taking a cool, steady
aim, fire!”</p>

<p>With what breathless suspense I stood, with my
rifle just resting upon the breastwork, endeavoring
to peer through the darkness, for now there was no
torch-light to be seen ashore. For an hour this lasted—no
sound save the rustling of the wind or the gentle
lashing of the waves—when there came upon my ears
a slight, dull noise as of the dipping of muffled oars.
Prabu must also have recognized it, for, stepping
softly along the little line of men, he whispered his
orders.</p>

<p>“Steady! they are coming! Fire not till you hear
the report of my piece.”</p>

<p>Then all was silent—motionless as death. The invaders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
had rested upon their oars, the better to prepare
themselves, perhaps. But a few minutes, and again
the sound of measured strokes. They appeared near,
nearer, still nearer; then a whispered word of command,
followed by the click, click of flint and steel,
and six or seven torches were blazing and exposing to
view the swarthy bodies of our opponents. It was
enough—the loud, sharp crack of the rifles of Prabu
and six others was followed by a howling as from a
thousand demons—a noise one could scarcely have
imagined out of pandemonium. Each shot must have
told, too; for the but recently advancing boats immediately
fell back into the middle of the channel, and
their crews extinguished the lights.</p>

<p>“Marvelously well done! After that they won’t return
to-night,” said I.</p>

<p>“Sahib,” replied Prabu, “reload—be prepared; they
will be here again directly.”</p>

<p>Prabu was right. Again and again they came, and
each time with greater desperation, for we could only
drive them back by firing volley after volley; but at
length our exertions were rewarded, for they were
driven back to return no more that night—at least,
so we hoped.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” I exclaimed, “morning is not
far off.”</p>

<p>“Too far off, I fear, Sahib,” replied Prabu, “to be
of use to us when it does come, for we have <i>but one
charge each</i> left!”</p>

<p>“A fearful position, truly!” I replied. “Would to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
Heaven the prahu were at hand! What <i>can</i> we do?”</p>

<p>“They may not come again to-night—but they
<i>may</i>; therefore let us remain at our posts, and reserve
fire this time until they have left their boats—then a
volley, and then—”</p>

<p>“What!” I asked, as the perspiration ran down my
forehead.</p>

<p>“That will be the end,” he replied, quite coolly; “for
all we can do then will be to die, with musket and
creese in hand.”</p>

<p>“A pretty prospect!” I thought. Nevertheless, I
had one consolation—my brother Martin would escape;
yet how bitter would be his sorrow at our defeat
and my death. There was little time, however,
for such reflections, for suddenly there fell upon our
ears a sound as if from mid-channel—click, click,
click—and the darkness became illumined by a hundred
torches, which as many savages held above their
heads, so rendering them hideous beyond comparison.
The click, clicking was explained; it had been caused
by their flints and steels.</p>

<p>“What means this manœuvre?” I cried.</p>

<p>“We shall soon be dead men. It only remains for
us to give them a well-aimed volley when they touch
the shore. But down, down, all of you, between the
breastworks!”</p>

<p>The order was indeed seasonable, for between every
two of the torchbearers stood a man with a strung
bow, and scarcely had we ducked our heads, than a
shower of arrows fell among us; to which our men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
now that there was no necessity for silence, sent back a
yell of defiance. Then came another and another flight,
and with such rapidity that, had we possessed fifty
rounds of ammunition, we could not have used them
to advantage. All that we could do now was to remain
kneeling behind the sandbank, reserving our
fire for one good, if but last, opportunity of making
each shot tell. The Balinese seemed to understand
our position, for we could hear them advancing
through the water, yelling and shouting. They were
terrible sounds, the more so as they were to us symbols
of approaching death; but I had “screwed my
courage to the sticking point,” not with any hope of
preserving my life, but resolutely determined to die
bravely. Onward they came—still onward; the
boats, which were now in front of the line with torches
and arrows, were grazing the shingles when Heaven
itself seemed to have sent its thunder to our aid, in
the booming of guns. This was followed by shrieks,
yells, and a heavy splashing in the water. Then came
another, and another boom! and by three red lights
at the mouth of the channel we could see that help was
at hand, for they hung from the prow and masts of
the prahu.</p>

<p>“Allah be praised!”</p>

<p>“Thank God! it is Kati.”</p>

<p>And as gun after gun was fired—clearing the water
of our foes—the gallant little vessel ran up the channel.
Then, lighting our torches, we clambered up the
sides of the prahu, and were speedily embracing Kati
and my brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>“By Jingo! Claud, old fellow, how lucky! we were
but just in the nick of time,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you have saved our lives by a minute,” replied
I.</p>

<p>“It was the great guns, Claud. Did I not tell you
they were meant for fighting, and at last we have
proved it.”</p>

<p>“But where did you find the prahu, Martin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, riding smartly away in a cove, out of sight
of that Dutch grab, which, by-the-by, Prabu, is upon
the lookout for us. I wanted to fight her, but old
Kati wouldn’t have it.”</p>

<p>“We will give her plenty of sea-room as soon as
possible,” answered Prabu; and then, giving orders
to run around the coast toward the province of Japan,
at the eastern extremity of the island, we—that is, all
that had been fighting upon the island—proceeded to
regale ourselves with the best of Kati’s stores.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br>

<small>WE LAND AT MOJOPAHIT, AND ARE IMPRISONED AS
REBELS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> forced far out of our intended course by the
Dutch grab, and along the coast of those provinces
of Java known to be ruled by chiefs or princes in the
interest of the European Government, Prabu, in fear
that a general description of the prahu might have
been sent to the latter, ordered his crew to set about
disguising the vessel with all speed. This they did by
re-painting her a totally different color, from stem to
stern; hewing down one of the masts, so that she
should have <i>one</i> instead of <i>two</i>, and altering in a very
artful manner, the character of her rigging. As for
Martin and me, he recommended us to blacken our
teeth, and color our skins to the mahogany hue of the
natives. Thus, with the addition of donning the scant
attire of the island seamen, we had soon become indistinguishable
from them, except, indeed, we should
happen to be very closely scrutinized by an European.</p>

<p>Well, we had run through the Straits of Bali, and
rounded Cape Sedano—the most easterly promontory
of Java—and had nearly made the entrance to the
Straits of Madura, when we fell in with a hurricane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
that so knocked us about that we were compelled to
put into the first harbor, without mast or rudder, in
fact, a mere hull, and that, too, with holes in her, that
required incessant working at the pumps. To make
matters worse, that port was near Mojopahit, once
the seat of empire of the ancient Buddhist Sultans of
Java, but now governed by a chief whom Prabu believed
to be a firm and fast friend of the Dutch Government.</p>

<p>“This is jumping out of the frying-pan into the
fire with a vengeance,” said I, as some of the native
authorities ascended the sides, to inquire who and
what we were, and for what purpose the prahu had
put into that harbor.</p>

<p>“We must brazen it out,” replied Martin. “As for
you and me, Claud, since we have turned mahogany
color, the best thing we can do will be to say nothing,
and look as savage as we can. It is a pity, though,”
he added, with a laugh, “that we are not a little uglier
and shorter, then they wouldn’t know us from their
own brothers.”</p>

<p>Prabu’s reply to our visitors’ queries was, that he
was a Batavian merchant of the lower town, who,
having been to Singapore with birds’-nests, had taken
in a cargo of cloth at Bali, and was then running
around the coast to Samarang upon the north coast;
and with this they appeared satisfied, but declared
they could not allow him to refit without he first obtained
the Chief’s permission. “Will my elder
brothers, then, carry a message to the Chief?” asked
Prabu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>“No, that they could not do, but they promised,
however, to come the next morning, and conduct him
to the feet of his lordship;” and with this—although
a personal interview was sorely against his inclination—he
was compelled to rest content.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next morning, in anticipation of
their coming, Prabu dressed himself as elaborately
and as handsomely as his wardrobe would permit; indeed,
we were astonished that he had on board such
fine linen, gorgeous sarongs, handsome turbans,
jeweled-hafted creeses, and golden rings and bracelets—enough,
indeed, to attire the whole three of us,
for we were to accompany him, to swell his state, as
his two chief officers; we were, however, no longer
surprised at all this finery, when he told us that the
people inhabiting that portion of the island had, from
all time, been noted for their love of show, and that,
without it, they would treat strangers with derision,
and their requirements with contempt.</p>

<p>By the way, the old traveler, Captain Dampier, gives
a humorous illustration of the importance attached
to mere dress by the Indian Islanders generally:</p>

<p>“Among the rest of our men,” says he, “who used,
when on shore to dance with the Chief and his people,
was one John Thacker, who was a seaman bred, and
could neither read nor write, but had formerly learned
to dance in the music-houses about Wapping. This
man came to the South Seas with Captain Harris, and
getting a good quantity of gold, laid some of it out in
the purchase of a very handsome suit of clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>“The Chief—supposing by the richness of his attire
and the quality of his dancing, that he must be
some person of consequence—asked one of Thacker’s
companions if he were not of noble birth.</p>

<p>“‘Your lordship is much in the right,’ replied the
seaman, who was interested in carrying on the deception;
‘and most of our ship’s company are of the like
extraction, especially all those who have fine clothes;
for, having money enough to bear their own expenses,
they have come abroad just to see the world. As for
those men your lordship sees with mean clothes, why
they are only common seamen.’</p>

<p>“This impudent falsehood had the desired effect
upon the native Prince, who thenceforth treated John
Thacker with the highest consideration. Unfortunately,
however, the Captain was not fond of practical
joking, so that when it came to his ears, he not
only undeceived the Chief, but caused a sound drubbing
to be administered to the pseudo noble.”</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, we were conducted to the
Chief’s palace, and were at once introduced to the hall
of audience, a large building, with open sides, the
roof of which was handsomely carved, ornamented
with vermilion and gold, and rested upon numerous
pillars. The Chief received us very graciously; and
having obtained satisfactory replies to the many questions
he asked, listened attentively to Prabu’s requisition
to be permitted to refit his vessel, and at once signified
his acquiescence. But, as we were about taking
our departure, there arose a great commotion at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
entrance end of the hall, and presently several officers
of justice appeared, bringing with them two men,
both kicking and struggling to release themselves, like
refractory school-boys. Of course, we stepped a little
forward to ascertain the cause of their apprehension.
The one was a Javanese, the other a Chinaman.
At the sight of the latter, I startled not a little, exclaiming,
“By Jove! Martin, here is that rascal To-ki
again.”</p>

<p>“The rogue! so it is,” he replied. But Prabu also
recognized him.</p>

<p>“The dog,” said he, “was formerly on board my
prahu, but he fled one night when we were in harbor
at Batavia, carrying with him all the dollars upon
which he could lay his hands.” Hence, thought I,
the reason of his trembling in that cave at the very
name of Prabu.</p>

<p>But now commenced one of those scenes so characteristic
of the courts of the native chiefs.</p>

<p>A woman of venerable aspect, but bent with age and
overwhelmed with grief, came forward, and, falling
at the feet of the chief, with clasped hands, said boldly,
as is the wont of the Javanese in such cases, “Justice,
oh! my lord, I demand justice. I have been
foully wronged. I will not submit to it! Justice I ask
upon the head of this villain Chinaman, for last night
he waylaid and slew my boy, my only son, the prop
of my numerous years, the staff of my existence!”</p>

<p>This charge having been corroborated by several
witnesses, beyond all doubt or hope of dispute, one of
the officials, turning to To-ki, cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>“Thou hast heard the charge. What, oh, dog of a
Chinese, hast to say to our lord the chief in reply?”</p>

<p>“The words of the miserable To-ki, whom the gods
have deserted, will be few, oh, dread lord and chief,”
he replied, in a whining tone. “It is true, but it is
also true that the wretched To-ki entered this city,
poor,—starving; and in an evil hour fell in with this
dog of a Javanese, who offered thy slave, oh, my lord,
a sum in silver, to rid him of a rat of an enemy; and it
is also true that the miserable To-ki could not resist
the temptation.”</p>

<p>Then the Javanese, being asked what he had to say,
replied, “Am I not known, my lord, as a peaceful
trader, and of good repute? is it then possible, under
heaven, that thy slave could have been guilty of so
great a crime? It is not so, oh, my lord, for upon the
features of this man thy slave never set eyes, until this
day. Surely,” he added, quite innocently, “this dog
of a Chinese, son of a burnt mother that he is, entered
the city as a robber and a slayer of men—but, having
been detected in the crime, places it at the door of the
first innocent man.”</p>

<p>The chief, having listened very attentively to these
different statements, gave his decision that they were
both guilty—</p>

<p>The Chinese, of having slain the man; and the Javanese,
of instigating the crime. To-ki being a poor
man, who could not pay his way out of the consequences
of his crime, be sentenced to lose his nose and
ears; while the Javanese was ordered at once to set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
aside a sum of money to keep the aged mother for the
rest of her days, and to lose his two ears: a sentence
which the man took quite coolly—but then he was rich—a
fact that materially modifies sentences in Java.
“It is a common custom,” says an old traveler, “to
bargain with the executioner for mitigating the punishment:
there is never a day but the chief orders a
nose, eye, ear, hand, or foot to be cut off from somebody
or other; and, upon these occasions, the executioner
gets money for doing his business handsomely, and
with little pain; for, if the criminal does not come up
to his price, and pay him in ready money upon the
spot, he will cut the nose, for instance, so deep that
the brain may be seen through the wound, or mangle
a foot or a leg with two or three knives—but, strange
to say, in all these cruel mutilations, scarce any one
dies, though some of the sufferers are above sixty
years of age; and the only remedy they use is, to put
the wounded part immediately into water; and, after
it has bled a little, wash it, and bind it up with linen
cloths.”</p>

<p>Not so quietly did our friend To-ki take his sentence;
on the contrary, he set up a yelling that almost
shook the hall of audience. Suddenly, however, his
eyes lighting upon Prabu and me, he burst into an
hysterical laugh, and, falling at the feet of the chief,
he exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Thy slave, oh, great chief, claims the remission
of his sentence!”</p>

<p>“What means the dog, is he possessed?” cried the
chief, kicking the kneeling man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>“Claims it,” continued To-ki, “as his reward for
giving into the great chief’s hands rogues, traitors,
for whose heads the Dutch chief at Batavia offers a
thousand dollars each. Let the great man cast his
lightning glance upon those dogs,” he added, pointing
to <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the meaning of these words was but
too intelligible to Martin and me, and we placed our
hands upon our cresses.</p>

<p>“Resistance is useless, sahibs, submit,” whispered
Prabu.</p>

<p>“What means the Chinese dog? Who is this man
that has come to us in the guise of a merchant and a
sailor?”</p>

<p>“Prabu, the slave, the descendant of the traitor
Surapati,” cried the Chinese.</p>

<p>Seeing the chief regarding him, as if in astonishment
and unbelief, Prabu advanced, and with an air
of dignity, said—</p>

<p>“O great chief, this Chinese dog is a thief and a
slayer of men for hire; but his words are good. I am
he they call Prabu, the descendant of Surapati.”</p>

<p>The chief arose, I thought, from the mild expression
in his eye and general manner, to pay his obeisance
to Prabu, but quickly, sharply, he said,—</p>

<p>“Then art thou a traitor and a rebel to our good
friends the Dutch—seize these dogs, and thy lives
shall answer for their safety,” he added, to his guards.
Whereupon we were all three secured, and taken at
once to a small, dark, fetid-smelling dungeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>“It has come at last; I said it would,” said Martin,
surlily, as the guards fastened the door after quitting
us.</p>

<p>“What is written <i>is</i> written,” was Prabu’s answer.</p>

<p>“That’s true, but it doesn’t follow that it can’t be
scratched out.”</p>

<p>“Shame, Martin!” I exclaimed, “we have long
since accepted our position, it is cowardice to complain
now.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he replied, good-humoredly, “perhaps
it is, Claud; still, to find oneself suddenly converted
into a traitor, from no cause of his own, and with a
fair prospect of being hanged, drawn, and quartered,
or some such agreeable ending, is enough to make
a fellow grumble. It is, as one may say, all he gets
for his money. But, come,” he added, “let us bestir
ourselves and think a little, for, among us, we may
yet hit upon some plan of escape.”</p>

<p>Well, we did think, and that as silently and diligently
as possible, for some two or three hours; but
then, taking stock of our thoughts, the result proved
<i>nil</i>, and something like a feeling of despair stole over
us.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed I, suddenly breaking a
prolonged silence; and we all jumped to our feet.
Ere, however, a word was spoken, the door turned
upon its hinges, and the chief himself, attended by a
slave bearing a lantern, stood in the room.</p>

<p>Instinctively our hands sought the handles of our
weapons; but the chief, waving his hand, as if to assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
us he intended no harm, bade the slave place the
lantern upon the floor and quit the dungeon; then, addressing
Prabu, he said,—</p>

<p>“Son of Surapati, I come to tell thee that thou and
thy companions are free to depart. I did but have
thee brought here for thine own safety. Thou wast
publicly denounced by the Chinese dog, as one for
whose head the hated Hollanders have offered a reward,
and thus was I compelled to appear thine
enemy, for even in my own palace are there spies to
be found.”</p>

<p>“Chief,” replied Prabu, with dignity—a greater
dignity than I had ever seen him assume; “this is
generous—noble! but only what, from thy manner, I
expected; and well I guessed that a descendant of
the once royal house of Mojopahit could keep but a
hollow truce, a mock amity, with the hereditary foes
of his race.”</p>

<p>“Allah be praised,” replied the chief, “that I have
it in my power to preserve the sole descendant of the
truest Javanese who ever lived! But get thee at once
from this place; a guide and horses await you all at
the entrance to the forest.”</p>

<p>“How, O Prince,” exclaimed Prabu, with astonishment,
“the prahu is a mere hull, but it will float us yet
out of danger.”</p>

<p>“Not so: a Dutch ship of war has, even within the
last three hours, entered the harbor, and in the morning
the captain will claim thee as his prisoner.”</p>

<p>“But the prahu—the cargo, they are the property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
of his highness, thy sovereign and mine, and I may not
desert them with life.”</p>

<p>“Fear not,” replied the prince, “for while in this
port, by my treaty with the Dutch, they are mine.
But,” he added, “hasten, lose no time, and place this
letter in the hands of his highness the Pangeran; it
will acquit thee of all blame; nay, raise thee in his
esteem.”</p>

<p>A minute’s reflection, and Prabu replied,—</p>

<p>“Chief, I cannot but believe thee, I consent; we will
seek the forest, and there remain till this Dutch ship
has taken her departure.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” replied the chief, “you must at once seek
the Pangeran, who has quitted Pugar, and is now at
Marang.”</p>

<p>“God is great!” exclaimed Prabu, surprised, and
not without cause, for Marang was several hundreds
of miles nearer than Pugar, at which province he believed
the Pangeran then to be. “But,” he added,
“the chief is right: I must at once seek the Pangeran.”</p>

<p>“But suppose this is all a hoax,” said Martin, with
rude bluntness.</p>

<p>“Even then,” replied Prabu, coolly, “our danger
will be no greater than now. It will be but the meeting
with a similar misfortune by another means. Better
fall by the hands of a treacherous Javanese than
be slain by the dogs of Hollanders.”</p>

<p>“A matter of taste, that; I should prefer the latter,”
replied my brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>Then the Chief, who, to my astonishment, instead
of exhibiting the wild anger so common to his race,
at the smallest insult, either fancied or real, merely
smiled at the words.</p>

<p>“The young Sahib,” he said, “must have suffered
great misfortunes, for his heart to be so full of suspicion.
But no more words, haste ye all,” he added,
as he opened the door and pointed to the guide, who,
with four small horses, stood awaiting us at a little
distance.</p>

<p>Once upon the back of my horse, or rather pony—for
in Java there are no horses worthy of the name—I
felt that we were safe: at the time, however, I but
little imagined the labor we should have to urge the
beasts through the brushwood and jungle; indeed,
after an hour or two’s coaxing, whipping, kicking
with spurless heels, I became of Martin’s opinion,
who—wet through with perspiration, engendered by
his endeavors to make his animal go at a little more
than a sharp walking pace—exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Oh, bother! an English donkey would be worth a
dozen of these brutes! I tell you what, Claud, I believe
we should save time by reversing our positions,
and carrying these animals on our shoulders;” at
which, by the way, Prabu administered a very proper
rebuke.</p>

<p>“These horses,” said he, “know their business better
than the Sahib Martin. They know that they have
to traverse mountain and valley—through brushwood
and jungle—and meet with tigers or snakes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
therefore they are slow; but they are cautious and
sure-footed.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied my brother, “the old story of ‘the
tortoise and the hare.’ Well, we must make the best
of it.”</p>

<p>But then his “making the best of it” consisted in
goading his pony till, becoming restive, it literally
“bolted,” and, in its rage, regardless of the character
Prabu had given him for sure-footedness, went, head foremost,
into the ruins of a huge tank, some twelve
feet deep.</p>

<p>“My brother is killed!” I exclaimed, half-frightened
out of my wits, as horse and rider suddenly disappeared
into an abyss, which, for what I then knew,
might be as deep as the chasm down which I had
fallen in the caves.</p>

<p>“Not kill! <i>tank</i> all full of grass and brushwood,”
said the guide; and, to my great satisfaction, so it
proved, for by the time we had reached the edge of
the tank Martin had clambered up its sides, and stood
before us rubbing his limbs.</p>

<p>“The ill-tempered brute!” he exclaimed, as we came
up to him. “But I hope he is not killed.”</p>

<p>“No, sahib; horse not kill!” replied our guide; and,
dismounting, he jumped into the tank, and in less
than half-an-hour we saw him leading the animal up
a slope.</p>

<p>Onward again along the side of this great tank,
which once supplied the inhabitants of Mojopahit;
through the vast ruins of palaces and magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
temples, overgrown with forest trees and jungle, where
once had stood the classic city of Java—the seat of
her ancient kings.</p>

<p>With awe and veneration I listened to the description
Prabu gave us of the former greatness of Mojopahit;
but scarcely with the same feelings did Prabu
regard these ruins.</p>

<p>“God is great!” he exclaimed. Pointing to fragments
of walls and pillars: “those were once the palaces
and temples of pagans—but what is written is
written—now they are the haunts of the beast of the
field; and the faith of the Prophet is triumphant
through the land!”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, as we rode onwards, “I have heard
that it was to a Hindoo or Buddhist king of Mojopahit
that Mahomedanism was indebted for its first
introduction into Java.”</p>

<p>“Under Heaven and the Prophet it was!” he replied.
And then he told us the following pretty
story:—</p>

<p>“About the year 1398 one Maulana Ibrahim, a
holy man of Arabia, having heard that the people of
so great an island were idolaters, resolved to bring
them over to the faith of the Prophet. Accordingly,
accompanied by his daughter, one of the most beautiful
women in the world, and a large retinue of attendants,
he landed in the island. Once here, by the
assistance of the Prophet, he succeeded in converting
a great number of the poorer classes of people. But
his heart yearned for the achievement of a greater victory—no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
less, indeed, than the conversion of Browijoyo,
king of Mojopahit—the then principal state in
Java.</p>

<p>“To effect this, he set out for the sovereign’s residence,
having first sent his son to inform his majesty
of the intended visit. Browijoyo, having heard of the
holiness of Maulana, set out to meet him, and receive
him with all due honor; but, upon their meeting, his
majesty became highly offended with his visitor, for
he presented him with a pomegranate in a very ordinary
basket—and with reason was the king indignant,
for that fruit, being one very common in Java, such a
present was the height of meanness—and so the king
left him, with feelings of great contempt, and Maulana
returned to the place where he had first landed.</p>

<p>“No sooner, however, had the holy man departed,
than his majesty, being seized with a violent headache,
mechanically stretched forth his hand for the
sweet-smelling pomegranate, when, lo! instead of the
delicious fruit, he found it was filled with magnificent
rubies. Astonished at the sight, he sent a messenger
to Maulana, begging of him to return, but the holy
man declined, affording as an excuse, that his only
daughter had just died. Pitying the bereaved parent,
the king immediately went to him, to offer what consolation
he might, and, moreover, desired to be permitted
to see the dead girl, for he had heard of her
wondrous beauty. This wish was gratified; but when
the attendants lifted the veil from the body, the king
became so dazzled with her beauty, that, falling upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
his knees, he prayed aloud that his Gods would restore
the soul of the girl to its lovely dwelling-place.</p>

<p>“‘Nay,’ cried Maulana, ‘call not upon <i>your</i> Gods;
they are of gold and ivory, and cannot hear you; mine
alone can lend a listening ear!’</p>

<p>“The king then, yielding to a heavenly influence,
addressed a prayer to the God of the true believers
and Mahomed his Prophet! when, to the astonishment
of all present, the dark circle round the eyes of
the corpse began to fade gently away, her lips to assume
the deep blush of the rose, a faint color to tinge
her cheeks, her long curled lashes were slowly raised,
revealing her large dark eyes,—which they had
thought closed forever—and she held out her hand
to the king, who became a Mussulman on the spot,
and married her.” So far Prabu’s legend. The true
story, however, according to the Javanese writers, of
the Mahomedan conversion, runs as follows:—</p>

<p>Among the wives of Browijoyo was a Chinese.
This lady, being repudiated by the king, was, with her
son, Raden Patah, sent to Arya Dama, chief of the
Javanese colony of Palembang, in Sumatra, the inhabitants
of which place had already embraced Islamism.
Radan Patah, when he grew up, accompanied
by Radan Husen, a son of Arya Dama by the second
mother, went over to Java. Both the young men
professed the faith of Mahomed; but while Radan
Patah assumed the character of a zealot and a devotee,
Radan Husen rested content with the promotion and
other advantages he received at the court of the Hindoo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
king Browijoyo, who made him governor of a
district, and gave him the command of his army.</p>

<p>Radan Patah, through the influence of his brother,
was permitted to settle in the district of <i>Damak</i>; his
conduct, however, creating some suspicion at court,
his brother paid him a visit, and prevailed upon him
to make his appearance there, and pay the accustomed
homage; in consequence of which the king not only
pardoned him, but created him <i>Adapali</i>, or governor
of Damak.</p>

<p>But no sooner did the new governor return to the
seat of his government than he began to intrigue for
the subversion of the national worship; and, having
at length succeeded in mustering a considerable force,
he gave the command to a Javanese. This general,
meeting the army of the king under Radan Husen,
was defeated and slain. Radan Patah, however, not
discouraged by this defeat, assembled a fresh army,
and gave the command to Kudus, a son of the slain
commander. The Hindoos and Mahomedans again
met, the result being the defeat of the former, the
capture and destruction of the ancient city of Mojopahit,
and the ultimate triumph of Mahomedanism,
which is <i>well ascertained</i> to have happened in the year
1478.</p>

<p>“It may be remarked,” says Crawford, “as a singular
coincidence, that the Mahomedan religion was
extending itself thus in Asia at the very time it was
expelled from Europe; and it is curious to observe,
that this important revolution was going forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
nearly at the same moment with the grandest events
in the history of man. Mojopahit was destroyed but
fourteen years before the discovery of America, and
but nine before Vasca di Gama doubled the Cape. It
was a moment, indeed, when the nations of the world
were becoming better acquainted with each other.
The European reader, in reflecting upon this subject,
will feel regret that the intolerant religion of Mahomed
should have anticipated the religion and civilization
of a more polished and improved portion of
mankind; but that regret will be moderated when he
considers the bigotry and cruelty of the <i>Portuguese</i>,
the first adventurers, and the mean, pitiful, and cruel
policy of their mercantile successors, the <i>Dutch</i>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br>

<small>THROUGH WOODS AND WILDS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Onward</span>, onward, for days, weeks; nay, more
than two months we traveled through forests so
dense, that without immense toil and a cunning
guide they would have been impassable. Gigantic
teak trees, thickets of colossal ferns, bamboos, rattans,
the wild laurel, gum-trees—across rivers and perilous
rapids, through valleys rendered deadly to man from
the neighborhood of those solfataros or semi-extinct
volcanoes which, from the fume of carbonic acid gas
escaping, asphyxiate all living creatures who dare to
rest within its influence. Along the ridges of that
immense volcanic range, named by travelers the blue
mountains, and whose crests soar to a height of nine
thousand feet above the level of the sea—by day seeking
our food from the wild pigs, deer, and pheasants,
which ever and anon crossed our path; by night two
of us sleeping, within a circle of fire, lighted partly
to preserve us from the pestiferous damps, or prowling
tigers, and fed with fuel by the other two, who
kept watch and ward.</p>

<p>The journey was indeed painful, wearisome.
Would it ever come to an end?—But another day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
and—hurrah! our hearts beat with joy, such a joy I
had never felt. We had at length reached the neighborhood
of human habitations—the land of man was
visible around. We had entered a vast valley shut in
by wooded hills, and moistened by pleasant brooks
and rivers, the sides of which for miles were studded
with trees in groves. We had in fact come to a sago
plantation, and thus knew that a village or town must
be at hand—a few miles more along the banks of the
widest of the streams, and we had reached a little
village of huts, which we afterwards found formed a
kind of outpost to the city of Marang itself. Speedily
our toils were forgotten in the warm hospitality of
the natives, who regaled us with their choicest fruits,
coffee, and sago cakes, and, greatest luxury of all,
after so long a sojourn in the wilds, sleeping-mats and
pillows, to say nothing of a separate hut, which the
head-man of the village, who constituted himself our
host, had placed at our disposal.</p>

<p>Now, as I have told you, it is the custom in Java
for the women to do all the field work; accordingly,
they quit their huts at a very early hour of the day.
But the morning after reaching the village, when we
left our sleeping-hut, we were surprised to see both
women and men idling about, and tricked out in their
best finery.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of all this, is it a jollification
day, I wonder?” asked Martin of Prabu; but the
latter, as if no less surprised, addressing the head-man,
our host, asked,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>“What day is this, oh my brother?”</p>

<p>“Can my elder brother have suddenly fallen from
the moon, that he knows not that this is the twelfth
of the month of <i>Rabbi ul awal</i>?”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>“Allah! and the Prophet pardon a miserable wretch
for having forgotten it,” exclaimed Prabu, adding
very truly, “but we must have lost our reckoning of
time in the wilds, for I thought it wanted two more
days to it. But Allah be thanked that we are yet in
time for the festival.”</p>

<p>“My elder brother,” replied the head-man, “has
committed no sin, for the day has only come, not
passed; but,” he added, “let my brother attire himself
fittingly, and accompany my party to Marang,
for the day will be a great one, greater than usual, to
do honor to the newly-arrived envoy from the unbelieving
Dutch chief at Batavia.”</p>

<p>“When, O my elder brother, did this Dutch envoy
arrive in Marang?” asked Prabu, with evident vexation,
if not fear, depicted upon his countenance.</p>

<p>“Three days since. It is believed that it was to
receive this Hollander, his highness the Pangeran left
Pugar, and came to his great palace of Marang.”</p>

<p>“Will the Hollander attend the ceremonies at the
palace?” asked Prabu.</p>

<p>“It is not known, but if my elder brother and his
two friends will join our party they will see,” replied
the head-man, and then again he offered to lend us the
holiday attire of villagers that we might make an appropriate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
appearance, and to don these we went into
his house.</p>

<p>“I say, Prabu,” said Martin while we were attiring
ourselves, “isn’t it a little foolhardy for us, and you
especially, to venture too near this Dutchman; won’t
it be to walk into the lion’s mouth?”</p>

<p>“Not so, sahib; he will not recognize us, even if
he has ever seen us before, for he cannot dream that
we are in this part of the island.”</p>

<p>“But why go at all into the city until this envoy
has quitted it, if there be any danger?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because, Sahib Claud,” replied Prabu, sternly,
“there is treachery at work in a quarter where I least
expected to find it, and I must scent it out; still, if
the sahibs fear, they can remain here.”</p>

<p>But the latter suggestion we would not listen to,
and so we were soon on our way with the villagers,
and upon the road to the city we were joined by
many hundreds of others, all journeying to witness
the grand reception of the chief nobles by their
Prince. But as this ceremony takes place annually, a
general description of it must suffice.</p>

<p>At an early hour of the day, each chief, accompanied
by his retainers attired in their gala dresses
and fully armed, and attended by drums and other
musical instruments, proceeds to the great square of
the palace, there to await the coming of the Prince.
I must here premise that every portion of the ceremony
is an outrage upon Mahomedan decorum, at
least as established in other countries; but then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
Javanese, although followers of the Prophet, are extremely
lax in all religious matters. When the Prince
makes his appearance, it is in the idolatrous garb of
his Hindoo ancestors, decorated with ponderous
golden bracelets, armlets, and finger-rings set with
diamonds. His retinue consists of persons whimsically
dressed in the ancient costume of Java, including
a great number of women, a strange contradiction
to the fastidiousness of the Mahomedans of other
countries. The most conspicuous of the latter are his
Highness’s ladies of the household—these bear the
ancient regalia. The latter, by the way, according to
American notion of regalia, is somewhat extraordinary,
consisting, for instance of old creeses, the
golden figures of a snake, a goose, and a deer;—equally
curious is the regalia of the Prince of Macassar
or Celebes, which consists of the Book of the laws
of God, the fragment of a small gold chain, a pair of
Chinese dishes, an <i>enchanted</i> stone, a pop-gun, some
creeses and spears; and, above all, a <i>revered</i> weapon,
called <i>sudang</i>; <i>i. e.</i>, a kind of cleaver or hanger, the
object of which, according to the naked language of
the people themselves, is to <i>rip open bellies</i>. But to
return to the Java prince.</p>

<p>After the ladies came several old women, bearing
arms in their hands, called langan-astru, very appropriately
too, for the meaning is <i>soldiers in play</i>. The
Prince, having arrived at the Sitingil, or terrace of
<i>ceremonies</i>, takes his seat upon the throne, the chiefs
of all ranks, from the highest to the lowest, squatting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
on the bare ground, the heir to the throne only being
admitted to a higher seat. The troops of all descriptions,
whether those of the household, or the rabble
militia of the princes, then pass before the Prince in
review, moving mostly according to the manners of
the country, in a strutting or dancing attitude, and exhibiting
costumes the most grotesque and ludicrous.
Some appear in ancient dress, others in the more
modern garb of the country. One portion of the ceremony
consists of a public charity according to the institution
of the Prophet. This consists of dressed
food, chiefly rice, piled up into a conical mass, of
four or five feet high, tastefully decorated with flowers,
and each mass supported in a separate litter,
borne amidst the sounds of a hundred bands of native
music by porters dressed for the occasion. From
their shape and size, and still more, because they are
thought to be emblematic of the bounty of the sovereign,
these masses of food are emphatically and
figuratively denominated mountains.</p>

<p>The method of distributing these viands is as
curious as it is, to say the least, ungracious; for,
after being duly exhibited in the procession, the
mountains are carried to the houses of the nobles of
rank, according to their size and qualities, and being
thrown down in their courtyards, there ensues, among
the retainers of the chiefs, an indecent but amicable
scramble for them.</p>

<p>There is, however, one portion of the festivities
that seriously outrages the institutions of the Prophet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
It is at the latter part of the day, when <i>wine</i> is served
plentifully, and the Prince quaffs some half a dozen
bumpers off to the health of his good friends and
allies. Now, this latter ceremony was the only portion
of the festival to which we could not be eyewitnesses,
as it took place in the banqueting-hall of
the palace, and in the presence only of the guests and
attendants. It appeared, however, to be the only portion
that Prabu was very desirous of witnessing. To
do this, he offered a bribe to one of the principal
slaves, but as it would have been at the risk of his
life, the man refused. Thus he was obliged to wait
in the city till the conclusion of the banquet, and then
content himself with its description from the mouth
of one of the attendants. This the man did very circumstantially
and tediously, and Prabu listened attentively
for some time, but at the sentence—“and
then his Highness, taking a flagon of wine in both
hands, stood up, and drank it to the dregs to the
health of the Dutch envoy, and his masters, the Government
at Batavia, between whom and himself there
was, and ever had been, a good and completely peaceful
understanding”—our captain, losing all self-control,
gnashed his teeth, and clutched the handle of his
creese, exclaiming,—</p>

<p>“False-hearted tyrant and coward, he has betrayed
his country!”</p>

<p>But the astonishment depicted upon the countenance
of the reciter of the speech at such treasonous
words restored him to his self-possession, and, taking
the man by the shoulder, he said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>“A long journey has made me mad. Not a word
of this to a living soul, as you value your life, for”—the
rest he whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>“The son of Surapati,” exclaimed the man, and
stricken and falling upon his knees, he added—“Allah
be praised! the people, oh, prince! wail thee as dead,
or, worse, in the power of the Dutch.”</p>

<p>Then dismissing him with a wave of his hand,
Prabu said to us,—</p>

<p>“Now, Sahib, you return to the village, I will remain;
but before I lay my head upon my pillow this
night, I must have speech with this Pangeran.”</p>

<p>“Madness, Prabu!” cried I; “for if he has betrayed
your cause, he will deliver you into the hands
of this envoy.”</p>

<p>“Even this attendant may betray you,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Go not, I pray—it is a wild scheme.”</p>

<p>“It is not madness—it is wisdom,” he replied,
coolly.</p>

<p>“Sahib Martin,” he added, “no native-born subject
of this prince will betray the son of Surapati,” so
saying he left us, and we returned with our host, the
head-man, and his people to the village.</p>

<p>Now, notwithstanding Prabu’s confidence in the
wisdom of his seeking an interview that evening with
the Prince, my brother and I felt seriously alarmed
for his safety. “For,” said Martin, “if this Prince,
who has for some time past been plotting against the
Government, has patched up a peace with the latter,
like all Asiatic tyrants in general, he will not scruple
to betray his recent friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>“I fear it may be so, Martin; yet let us hope the
best. Prabu is not wanting in cunning; he would not
wantonly and without some great object thrust his
head into the lion’s jaws. After all, this warm welcome
given to the envoy, and professions of amity
with his master, may be but a <i>ruse</i> on the part of the
Prince to gain time—who knows?”</p>

<p>“Who knows indeed?” repeated Martin. And for
three or four hours we sat thus conversing and cogitating,
till at length, fairly worn out with fatigue, I
proposed that we should stretch ourselves upon our
mats, as there seemed but little probability that the
subject of our thoughts would return that night.</p>

<p>“True, Claud,” replied my brother, “I do not think
he will return to-night—still, I don’t like sleeping
before I know the result of his interview.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the Prince has caused him to be seized,
Martin.” But at the same moment the door of the
hut flew open, and Prabu stood before us, not only
free and unharmed, but with every mark of satisfaction
upon his countenance.</p>

<p>“Thank God, you are safe!” exclaimed my brother.</p>

<p>“Allah be praised for <i>all</i> things!” he replied.
“But,” he added, “what harm <i>could</i> happen to the
son of Surapati in the palace of the Pangeran of
Pugar and Marang?”</p>

<p>“Then his Highness is still thy friend?” I said.</p>

<p>“He is more, Sahib—he is a true-hearted Javanese;
for which Allah be forever praised!”</p>

<p>“Yet,” said Martin, incredulously, “he is giving a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
warm welcome to the envoy of his greatest enemies.”</p>

<p>“Sahib,” he replied, “there are some things that
may not be poured into every ear—this is one of them.”</p>

<p>“A satisfactory reply, truly,” replied Martin. “I
tell you what,” he added, “this Prince has been found
out, and is thus compelled to make terms with the
Dutch.”</p>

<p>“It matters not—it matters not,” replied Prabu,
“the storm has passed over, yet the thunder is still
in the air, the bolt ready to fall. But,” he added, as
if anxious to get rid of an unpleasant subject, “has
the sahib Martin forgotten his cousin?”</p>

<p>“Prabu,” replied my brother firmly, “you know
I have not. Placing full reliance upon your promise
to restore her to us, I have not since mentioned her
name. But why that question? You are not one to
utter idle words. Is she in this city? In Heaven’s
name, tell me.”</p>

<p>“Let the sahib stretch his patience to a length of
three more days, and Prabu’s promise shall be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“Three days!” repeated Martin, bitterly, “why not
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“It cannot be: to-morrow the Prince and the envoy
attend a great tiger-hunt.”</p>

<p>“Then she <i>is</i> in the power of this <i>Prince</i>?”</p>

<p>“I <i>said</i> not so, Sahib; but rest content—my words
have gone forth, and shall not prove idle wind. In
the meanwhile, know that she is well cared for and
happy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>This information was good, but it was tantalizing,
and filled us with anxiety—an anxiety, indeed, that
would have been unbearable had we not possessed
such entire confidence in the integrity of Prabu.
Then the latter, guessing our thoughts and feelings,
said,—</p>

<p>“The sahib Martin longs to join in a tiger-hunt.
Treachery disappointed him in Bali. He shall go
with the hunters to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Bother! my mind is occupied with other things,”
was the surly reply. But the next minute he said:
“What must be, must, and I suppose I <i>must</i> go. You
go, of course, Claud, for it will at least serve to divert
our thoughts.”</p>

<p>And to this I consented, although such scenes have
no attraction for me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>

<small>WE HUNT TIGERS, AND DISCOVER SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late, very late, when we awoke the next
morning.</p>

<p>“The sun is already high in the heavens,” said
Prabu. “Hasten; as it is we shall not reach the
hunting-party in time to set out with them.”</p>

<p>“Bother, how we have slept! Why did you not
arouse us earlier?” said Martin.</p>

<p>However, in a very short time we had finished our
breakfast, and with our rifles (which, by the way, the
chief of Mojopahit had thoughtfully provided for us)
slung across our backs, and our creeses in our girdles,
we were urging our slow but sure-footed ponies in
the direction of Marang. But unfortunately the place
of rendezvous was a full mile on the other side of the
city. Thus, upon reaching it, we were mortified to
find that the Pangeran and his party had started
nearly two hours before. It was vexatious, for Prabu
was ignorant of the route; fortunately, however, we
procured a guide, and off we started. Our course
lay through a country as wild as that through which
we had traveled some days before; and never do I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
remember seeing so much game in so short a time:
bustards, cranes, jackals, foxes, and even wild buffaloes,
and pigs, were either in our path, or to be seen
upon all sides.</p>

<p>“Far better remain here, and bag a few of these
animals, Martin, than run the risk of getting our
necks beneath a tiger’s claws.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” he replied; “but I have long wished
to see a tiger-hunt, and, therefore, I for one won’t
lose so good an opportunity, but onward. Do urge
on that worse than donkey of yours, old fellow!”</p>

<p>Onward we went; beating as we went the bushes,
dank weeds, long grass, and jungle; at times trampling
upon snakes—at another narrowly escaping
being gored by a wild pig we startled out of a comfortable
nap. Then, in some of the open places, near
pools of standing water, we fell in at last with the
footprints of tigers, by which we knew that we were
on the right track. After a ride of ten miles, and as
we were descending the slope of a hill, we caught
sight of the hunting-party. They had halted in a
plain covered with high jungle-grass and thick
bushes.</p>

<p>“They have found the tigers,” cried Prabu.
“Quick!” but greatly as we increased our speed, we
were not in time for the beginning of the hunt. We
saw, however, their plan of action. The spearmen,
about a hundred in number, were distributed in a
circle around an immense thicket, and, sprinkled
among them, were men with drums, tom-toms, and
many other <i>un</i>musical instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>“Who are in those howdahs, Prabu?” I asked,
pointing to three elephants, which stood in line with
their tails toward us, and at intervals of a hundred
yards each.</p>

<p>“That to the left,” he replied, “contains the Dutch
envoy, the next holds the Pangeran, and the other,
which is nearest those teak trees and with the spearmen-guard
around, contains the chief ladies of his
Highness’s household.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Martin; “then, as we have no
especial desire to run into the lion’s jaws, or, in other
words, catch the eye of his Excellency the Dutchman,
we will advance by the ladies’ elephant.”</p>

<p>But as we spoke the drums were beaten, and the
spearmen began to narrow their circle, till they were
near enough to the thicket to thrust their weapons
into it; at the same time, eager to be nearer the scene
of action, the envoy and Pangeran moved forward
their elephants till their chests touched the prickly
canes. <i>We</i> rested for a minute to watch their movements.</p>

<p>Suddenly the spearmen gave a terrific yell, and,
beating their way into the thicket, were soon lost to
view. The prince and envoy followed; the huge
beasts upon which they sat forcing their own way by
the strength and bulk of their bodies.</p>

<p>“They have started a whole den,” cried Prabu;
“the tigers will be out either at the back or the front.
Follow! but,” he added, “they may come out at this
side—be wary—reserve your fire till the last moment!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
Having given this caution he gallantly
dashed forward, and entered the thicket through the
opening made by the elephants.</p>

<p>“Come on, Claud; don’t lag! This is fine sport!”
cried Martin.</p>

<p>We set our ponies at a canter, and made for an
opening about a dozen yards to the left of that entered
by Prabu, having no desire to get up with the
elephants and their riders, but at the very entrance
the animals stood stock-still, with their fore legs
stretched forward, and began to snort, and tremble
from their backs to their hoofs.</p>

<p>“The beasts scent an enemy, Martin; dismount.”</p>

<p>In an instant we were upon our feet, and the animals,
taking advantage of the change, turned tail and
scampered off in a style that somewhat astonished us,
after our experience of their regulation speed.</p>

<p>“It is my opinion we have done a foolish act,” said
I, chagrined at the escape of the horses.</p>

<p>“More foolish to remain half-way. Onward,
through the thicket, Claud,” replied my brother.</p>

<p>But a terrific growl, and a huge tigress, with a
spear through her shoulder, leaped forth, and miraculously
<i>passed</i> us. In her rage, and probable pain,
no less than fear at the great number of her enemies,
she darted by unheedingly of two such puny hunters
as ourselves; but suddenly she stopped to attack a
nobler prey—the elephant with the ladies on its back!
The spearmen-guard fled like cowards, as they were—then
slaying the poor mahout with a single blow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
her paw, the savage cat, gnashing her teeth, roaring
and foaming with rage, leaped upon the elephant’s
back, clinging with her huge claws to the frail howdah.</p>

<p>“The women! the women!—to their rescue!”
shouted my brother.</p>

<p>I was, for the moment, bewildered; and, clutching
his arm, cried,—</p>

<p>“Stay!—for Heaven’s sake, stay! It would be
madness to go!”</p>

<p>“Stand by, Claud!” he replied, fiercely, shaking me
off—“it would be <i>cowardice</i> to remain here!” and
running up to the elephant, he took quick aim—too
quick, for the bullet but grazing its sides, the beast,
hearing the approach of its new enemy, crouched
down, lashed her tail with fury, and gave one sharp,
long growl. Martin drew his creese, but it would
have been as useless as a bodkin to have preserved his
life, had not a bullet from my rifle caused the animal
to reel over; taking instant advantage of this, my
brother again and again plunged his weapon into its
sides. The brute being killed, we clambered to the
assistance of the shrieking women within the howdah.
Tearing aside the curtains, we saw two girls, half
dead with fright, supporting the form of another.
But at the sight of that other, I exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Thank God, Martin, <i>you</i> were <i>no</i> coward!”</p>

<p>“Marie, Marie!—our cousin! She is lifeless—perhaps,
dying! Water, Claud, water!” but it was unnecessary,
she had but swooned, for reviving, she took
a hand of each, saying,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>“My cousins, my dear cousins! Heaven alone
must have sent you to our aid. It was at your peril
I fainted. But the Princess?” she said, turning to one
of her companions.</p>

<p>“Is, thanks to these brave sahibs, dear Marie, unharmed.”</p>

<p>“How is it that <i>you</i> are here in this howdah? Who
are these ladies?” asked Martin, very savagely, for, as
he afterwards told me, he feared that all three were
the wives of the Pangeran.</p>

<p>“Dear Martin,” she replied, “you frighten me with
that fierce look. These ladies are the daughter of the
Prince and her attendants, and I am here as the friend
and companion of the Princess. But, my dear cousin,
how rejoiced am I to see you, for they told me you
were dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” he replied, as fiercely as before; “no, not
at all dead!—but, I tell you, Marie, I either soon
shall be, or take you from such heathen companionship.
But, dear Marie, what is this Prince like?—is
he young or old?—good-natured or cruel? How is it
that you are in his household?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Martin. I have never seen him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know!—have never seen him?” repeated my
brother, incredulously.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “but I shall now for the first
time. See, he is coming toward us; some of the
slaves have warned him of his daughter’s danger.”</p>

<p>It had been as Marie surmised; warned of his
child’s peril, the Pangeran had dismounted from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
elephant, and, taking an attendant’s horse, now came
galloping up to us. The slain mahout—the dead
tiger—his daughter and her companions apparently
in close converse, at once told him the story of her
late peril, and to whom he was indebted for her present
safety.</p>

<p>“Allah be praised! my daughter is safe,” he exclaimed.
“To the brave young sahibs, whoever they
are, I am indebted for the preservation of her dear
life; let them ask what they will that it is in my power
to bestow, it shall not be refused.” But, gazing upon
him as he spoke, we were astonished. It would be
impossible to describe the surprise expressed upon the
features of Marie and my brother.</p>

<p>“By jingo, it’s Madame Ebberfeld’s cousin, the
Prince; we are then in the very heart of the conspiracy,”
said Martin. The Prince, in his turn surprised
at the words, said,—</p>

<p>“Who, then, are you, who speak so glibly of Madame
Ebberfeld, and her cousin, the Prince?” Then,
as if suddenly remembering our features, he exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Ah, I see—God is great! the brave sahibs are
Madame’s nephews.”</p>

<p>“We <i>are</i>,” replied Martin, firmly, “and <i>you</i> are the
man, then, who stole away our cousin; but you have
said that you could refuse us nothing; give us, then,
at once our cousin, and we will forgive you all the
past.”</p>

<p>“The young Sahib is hasty, let him bridle his impatience
till we return to the palace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>“No, not I, you are evading my request; I will
not budge an inch till you have promised that we
may take her from this place when we choose,” and
the foolish fellow held his naked creese in his hand,
as if ready to defy the Pangeran and all his retainers.
To my astonishment, the Prince, although he at first
bit his nether lip with vexation, only smiled at this
Captain Bobadil style of proceeding. Many of the
natives, however, who had by this time flocked
around, placed their hands upon their creeses, and
their eyes upon those of their master; a single glance
from the latter, and there would have been a speedy
termination to the Quixotic Martin’s career. But
that glance was not given, the Prince mildly begged
that he would be patient, and that as soon as he had
communicated with Mynheer Ebberfeld, Marie’s
guardian, she should be delivered to us. But this
reply added fuel to the fire: it nearly drove my
brother frantic.</p>

<p>“Mynheer Ebberfeld,” he exclaimed, “is a rogue;
he it was who caused her to be stolen away. No,
Prince,” he added, “you may kill me, if you will; it
will be a grateful return for the preservation of your
daughter’s life, but I will not budge from here, nor
permit my cousin, either, until the envoy comes up;
he is a Dutchman, and powerful, and although he
may seize upon me as an associate of the enemies of
his Government, I will demand my cousin at his
hands.”</p>

<p>“Then, if the young Sahib will not be patient, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
must,” replied the Pangeran good-humoredly; “we
will await here the coming of the envoy; but the
Hollander, with haste and impatience like unto your
own young man, quitted his elephant, and proceeded
into the jungle on foot with the spearmen. But what
means this—what has happened?” he exclaimed, as
with a strange yelling noise a party of spearmen,
headed by Prabu, came through the thicket, bearing
what appeared to be the body of a man upon an improvised
litter formed by their spears.</p>

<p>As they approached, the Prince and his party became
silent—silent as death in breathless suspense,
but when the litter was set upon the earth his Highness
exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“God is great, it is the envoy, dead or sadly
wounded.”</p>

<p>“Not dead,” murmured the wounded man, “thanks
to the brave Prabu, who saved me from the tiger’s
jaws, and so insured me at least Christian burial—yet
dying.” But as he fixed his fast-closing eyes first
upon the howdah, and then upon Martin and me, he
exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“But yon girl, what does she here at this moment?—those
young men, what demon hath brought them
to witness my punishment?” He swooned from pain
and loss of blood, which was gushing from the
wounds in his neck and chest, made by the tiger’s
claws. Need my reader be told that in the Dutch
envoy we saw</p>

<p class="center">MYNHEER EBBERFELD.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>The conspiracy against us three cousins was being
gradually unraveled, but the suffering of our enemy
made us forget our enmity.</p>

<p>“<i>We can hate no longer</i>, Claud, for God hath taken
unto himself the punishment of the robber of the
orphan.”</p>

<p>“But we can do more, my cousins,” said Marie,
and slipping down the side of the elephant before we
could even go to her aid, she ran to the dying man,
and, kneeling, added, “We can forgive, for we are
Christians.”</p>

<p>“Marie,” exclaimed Martin, as, going forward, he
and I knelt by her side, “you have taught us our
duty; let us pray God to pardon this dying sinner.”</p>

<p>What must have been the feelings of that bad man,
as, recovering from his swoon, he saw kneeling and
praying to God for his forgiveness, the orphans he
had so deeply injured, I know not; but with his last
breath he said,—</p>

<p>“Marie, I have heard of angels—surely you must
be akin to them, for you pray for me who ruined you.
Boys! had I lived another month, your whole fortune
would also have been lost to you; Prince,” he added,
turning to the Pangeran, “to thee as to all I have
been false, examine the papers in my house, and you
will see that had Heaven extended my life another
moon, you would have been sacrificed; but I ask not
<i>your</i> forgiveness, it is not in the nature of a Javanese
to pardon so great an enemy.”</p>

<p>At this but too plain intimation of his treachery toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
himself, the Pangeran gnashed his teeth, but
the sight of three young people in prayer for the
forgiveness of their direst enemy softened even his
savage nature.</p>

<p>“Ebberfeld, thou bold, bad man,” he said, taking
his hand, “thou art wrong even in this; there is no
nature so savage that may not be taught by good
deeds; even I forgive thee, for the voice of Allah
speaks to my heart through the lips of these children.”</p>

<p>But Mynheer spoke no more—he had died; and
let us hope in such a thorough heartfelt repentance
that his soul passed into the keeping of his Creator.
But enough of this sorry scene and sad ending to
that day’s sport for which Martin had so long wished;
such an ending, however, is not an uncommon one in
the East, but then hunters are more prone to describe
their victories than their defeats. But there were two
other sufferers by the day’s hunting—the poor mahout
who had been slain by the tiger, and the noble
elephant. It was with difficulty we could coax the
beast from the body of his late friend and master.
His almost human sorrow reminded me of a story I
had once read, and which I must be pardoned for repeating
here.</p>

<p>“A tiger having attacked a party who were traveling
in a howdah, and slain the mahout or driver, the
elephant slew the beast with his feet; but the noble
animal had not saved his friend, so, says the narrator,
he became abstracted in gloomy contemplation, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
gazed with more than human sympathy upon the
dying mahout. He noticed us not! and as his eye
fell on the dead tiger, he stamped, looked fierce, and
made a trumpeting noise as if in triumph at having
avenged his friend’s death! Then, as if remembering
he had avenged, but not saved, his ears and trunk
drooped, and though he himself was torn and bleeding,
his moist and thoughtful eye gave token that all
his feelings were absorbed in grief for him he had lost.
He stood over and watched the men who were making
a kind of litter for the purpose of carrying away
the dead man, with the anxiety and grief of the most
affectionate of friends, nor would he touch food for
some days afterwards. Truly, I could never tire of
relating anecdotes of this noble creature.”</p>

<small>AND LAST, CONTAINING A TOLERABLY HAPPY ENDING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> his return to the palace, to which place we
accompanied him, the Pangeran gave Marie permission
to choose her day of departure, further promising
to send an escort with her to Batavia.</p>

<p>“That will be as soon as my cousins are prepared
to set out,” she replied, quickly.</p>

<p>“Then the day is distant, for the Sahibs dare not—it
would be unwise—entrust themselves in Batavia
until we hear in what odor they stand with the Dutch
Government; but let them rest content beneath this
roof until I can send a messenger, who will prove to
his Excellency that their association with Prabu and
his crew was from accident, not design.”</p>

<p>“Be it distant or near, Prince,” replied Marie, “I
will not enter Batavia without them.”</p>

<p>“Be it so,” replied the Pangeran; “in the meantime,
let the preservers of my daughter’s life regard
themselves as my sons beneath this roof;” and then
we parted for the night, waiting until the next day for
explanations.</p>

<p>“Now, Marie,” said I, the following morning, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
we were all together, “tell us the story of your adventures
since our parting.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she replied, “there is not much to tell.
Well, of course I was terribly frightened when that
old hunchback, the snake-charmer, entered my room,
and, without a word, bandaged my eyes and carried
me off; but as we went through the streets of the city,
he spoke kindly words, telling me I had no harm to
fear if I would not attempt to get away; and I really
believe he meant what he said: but when, taking me to
a house, and pushing me into a room, he desired me
to change my dress for another that I should find at
hand, and to be careful to leave also my <i>watch</i>, <i>locket</i>,
and <i>purse</i>, I had no doubt that both robbery and murder
was his intention, and I prayed and cried, and
cried and prayed terribly.”</p>

<p>“I now see how Mynheer came by the jewels and
clothes; it was a cunning conspiracy,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Why, what did <i>he</i> say about them?” she asked.</p>

<p>“He produced them as a proof that you had been
drowned, for he told us they had been found in the
river,” said I.</p>

<p>“The cruel, bad man! then he was at the bottom of
it all: he wanted to get my fortune! But,” she continued,
“my fears were groundless, for, as soon as I
had changed my attire, he came into the room, and,
rebandaging my eyes, led me forth and set me before
him upon a horse. In that manner we journeyed many,
many miles, till we came to the foot of the mountain,
where were several savage-looking men, evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
waiting to receive me, for no sooner did we come up
with them than they placed me upon another horse,
and so we traveled over mountains, across rivers, and
through forests, sometimes sleeping under a small
tent, which they carried with them for my sole use, at
others in the huts of villages; and thus, after many
weeks, we arrived at a large palace, and then I soon
began to forget my trouble, for I was introduced into
the apartments of that sweet princess, with whom I
soon became on the most intimate terms; but, notwithstanding
our friendship, she would never (she
said she dared not) tell me in what part of Java the
palace was situated, to whom it belonged, or for what
reason I had been stolen away from home. Well, in
that palace I remained many months, being permitted
every liberty and luxury within its walls, and those
of its gardens, but never being allowed to pass without,
or to be in the presence of one of the slaves,
whom it might be possible to coax any information
from, without the presence of the princess, my friend,
or one or two of her devoted attendants. At length
one day—not seemingly more than three months since—the
Princess told me that her father, the Pangeran,
whoever he might be, was about to remove, with the
whole of his household, to another palace, some hundreds
of miles away. This mattered but little to me, so
long as the Princess was with me, for it would be but a
change of residence, and so I cheerfully prepared for
and set out on the journey. As I expected, when we
arrived here, I found but little difference in our mode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
of life. One day, however, I did manage to elude the
vigilance of the Princess and her ladies, and hold a
conversation with one of the female slaves. I learned
from her two pieces of information: one, that my host
or jailer was the Pangeran of Marang; another, that
an envoy, a Dutchman, was then in the city, and that,
for his Excellency’s amusement, the Pangeran had
ordered a tiger-fight. At this news, I, who had become
domesticated in the palace, and had not for a
long time either thought or desired to escape, began
to pant for my liberty—liberty to go back even to that
bad home in Batavia. Disguising my real intention,
I confessed to the Princess that I had discovered who
her father was, and also about the intended tiger-fight.
I knew it must be a horrid, dreadful sight, but
I thought if I could persuade the Princess to take me
with her in her howdah, that we might by chance get
near the Dutch envoy; and in such an event, I had
fully resolved to beg of him to set me at liberty—to
take me back with him to Batavia; but little did I
imagine that I should be pleading for liberty to the
very man who had taken it from me! Well, so earnestly
did I beg of my Princess to let me accompany
her, that she consented, and I went; and now I have
told you my adventures. They are not very frightful,
are they? nor very romantic, either—only a little
girl you know kept out of the way while her uncle-in-law
could spend all her money!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, dear Marie, I fear it is but too true that
he <i>has</i> spent it, for did he not confess that he had
ruined you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>“Then, Martin, I shall have to work for my living,
that is all. I will be a governess, or a companion, to
one of the Dutch ladies in Batavia.”</p>

<p>“No, Marie,” replied my brother, impatiently,
“Claud and I have money; you shall share it, as you
have a right: it has been left to us by your father;
and then we will all return to America, for you, like
ourselves, have many relations there.”</p>

<p>“Martin,” said I, “you forget that we are even
now, perhaps, regarded by the Dutch Government as
rebels; if so, we have no fortunes; they have been, or
will be, confiscated;” and, with a bitter laugh, my
brother replied,—</p>

<p>“Let us wait till we hear from Batavia, and don’t
prophesy evil, you old witch, for it is sure to come
true.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I now prophesy that, in spite of all
dark clouds above us, we shall <i>not</i> be punished as
rebels—that our fortunes are not, will not be confiscated.”</p>

<p>“The sahib Claud has prophesied correctly,” said
Prabu, who, unobserved by any, had been standing
in the doorway some few minutes.</p>

<p>“What mean you, Prabu?” we asked.</p>

<p>“I will read this,” he replied, showing us a letter
in the Javanese character.</p>

<p>He did—it was from the friendly Chief or Prince
of Mojopahit, containing a warning to Prabu to beware
of venturing near any district under the influence
of the Dutch Governor-General, as his Excellency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
had issued a free pardon to all of the followers
of Prabu, calling himself the descendant of Surapati.
But for Prabu himself another reward, in addition to
that already issued, had been offered for his capture
or death.</p>

<p>“True,” said Martin, thoughtfully, “if we have ever
been counted among the rebels, this includes our pardon;
but,” he added, “now more than ever, my brave
friend, am I inclined to remain by thy side.”</p>

<p>“Sahib Martin,” replied Prabu, kindly, but firmly,
“you must not, shall not remain with one who may be
hunted through the length and breadth of Java. You
have youth, health, and hope. It may be written that
your life shall be long, happy, and prosperous. With
Prabu the future is blank. His degenerate countrymen
have again made their peace with their enslavers.
He has outlived Javan honor and patriotism. But,”
he added, fiercely, “the day may and will come when
the hated Hollanders shall be driven into the sea. It
might have been now—the time was ripe—but for
that dog!” Then, his anger lashed to fury, he cried,
“Would that he were alive again to fall by my creese!”</p>

<p>“Better,” said I, “that he is no more;” for I knew
that he alluded to Ebberfeld.</p>

<p>“The sahib is right—it is,” he replied, in subdued
tones; “for had the dog lived another month, he would
have betrayed his Highness the Pangeran into the
hands of the vile Dutch.”</p>

<p>“But how?” said I; “was he not here for the purpose
of cementing firmly the new peace and friendship
between the Dutch Government and the Pangeran?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>“That was the <i>supposed</i> purport of his coming; but
listen, and you will learn the real object. It was to
watch till the Pangeran committed some overt act that
might be construed into a just cause for robbing him
of his dominions. I tell you, Sahib, this dog Ebberfeld
did but join the patriots to worm themselves into
our secrets, to fan the rising flame and then to betray
them. And if, in the first instance, he <i>was</i> led to join
us by his hatred to the Dutch, a ready pardon, and the
promise of half the Pangeran’s wealth, was to be his
reward for his treachery.”</p>

<p>“But how know you all this?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Partly,” he replied, “from this letter from the
Prince of Mojopahit, chiefly from papers found last
night in his house. Allah forgive him! his sins were
many.”</p>

<p>“Now, Prabu, one question: What reason could you
have for keeping secret from us so long our cousin’s
whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“It was the Pangeran’s secret, Sahib. He wanted
money, and Ebberfeld proposed the abduction of Marie,
that he might inherit her fortune. It was a sin, but
he has atoned for it—neither has harm nor even discomfort
happened to her while under his roof.”</p>

<p>“It was a black business, though,” said Martin.
“Nevertheless,” he added, “‘all’s well that ends well,’
and so we will say no more about it. But now, Prabu,
you have not told us what you intend doing.”</p>

<p>“Seek service with the truest of Indian islanders,
the Rajah of Blilling, in Bali, for he and his race<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
are free men; their soil is unstained by the feet of
European conquerors. There will I bide my time, as
all must who believe that the day will come when the
Dutch hucksters will be driven from Java.”</p>

<p>Reader, I have nearly done. I have only to add
that, within a week, laden with presents from the
Pangeran, we were on our road to Batavia. Upon
our arrival in that city, we found that Madame Ebberfeld,
having heard of her husband’s death, had made
arrangements to again enter the bonds of matrimony
within a week. At this, I may tell you that I was not
at all surprised, as it is not at all unusual to find ladies
among the Colonists who have married ten or twelve
husbands.</p>

<p>In conclusion: By the interest of one of our uncle’s
old friends, at the time appointed by his will, we obtained
our fortunes.</p>

<p>By way of postscript, perhaps, the reader may like
to know that I am even now living under the roof of
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Black, and that Marie and her
husband spend many a long evening in chatting with
their bachelor brother anent our adventures in Java
and the Indian Archipelago.</p>
